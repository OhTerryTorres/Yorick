		<string>I do the wrong, and first begin to brawl.
The secret mischiefs that I set abroach
I lay unto the grievous charge of others.
Clarence, whom I, indeed, have laid in darkness,
I do beweep to many simple gulls
Namely, to Hastings, Derby, Buckingham;
And say it is the queen and her allies
That stir the king against the duke my brother.
Now, they believe it; and withal whet me
To be revenged on Rivers, Vaughan, Grey:
But then I sigh; and, with a piece of scripture,
Tell them that God bids us do good for evil:
And thus I clothe my naked villany
With old odd ends stolen out of holy writ;
And seem a saint, when most I play the devil.</string>

		<string>A fool, a fool! I met a fool i&apos; the forest,
A motley fool; a miserable world!
As I do live by food, I met a fool
Who laid him down and bask&apos;d him in the sun,
And rail&apos;d on Lady Fortune in good terms,
In good set terms and yet a motley fool.
&apos;Good morrow, fool,&apos; quoth I. &apos;No, sir,&apos; quoth he,
&apos;Call me not fool till heaven hath sent me fortune:&apos;
And then he drew a dial from his poke,
And, looking on it with lack-lustre eye,
Says very wisely, &apos;It is ten o&apos;clock:
Thus we may see,&apos; quoth he, &apos;how the world wags:
&apos;Tis but an hour ago since it was nine,
And after one hour more &apos;twill be eleven;
And so, from hour to hour, we ripe and ripe,
And then, from hour to hour, we rot and rot;
And thereby hangs a tale.&apos; When I did hear
The motley fool thus moral on the time,
My lungs began to crow like chanticleer,
That fools should be so deep-contemplative,
And I did laugh sans intermission
An hour by his dial. O noble fool!
A worthy fool! Motley&apos;s the only wear.

[What fool is this?]

O worthy fool! One that hath been a courtier,
And says, if ladies be but young and fair,
They have the gift to know it: and in his brain,
Which is as dry as the remainder biscuit
After a voyage, he hath strange places cramm&apos;d
With observation, the which he vents
In mangled forms. O that I were a fool!
I am ambitious for a motley coat.

[Thou shalt have one.]

It is my only suit;
Provided that you weed your better judgments
Of all opinion that grows rank in them
That I am wise. I must have liberty
Withal, as large a charter as the wind,
To blow on whom I please; for so fools have;
And they that are most galled with my folly,
They most must laugh. And why, sir, must they so?
The &apos;why&apos; is plain as way to parish church:
He that a fool doth very wisely hit
Doth very foolishly, although he smart,
Not to seem senseless of the bob: if not,
The wise man&apos;s folly is anatomized
Even by the squandering glances of the fool.
Invest me in my motley; give me leave
To speak my mind, and I will through and through
Cleanse the foul body of the infected world,
If they will patiently receive my medicine.</string>

		<string>Our remedies oft in ourselves do lie,
Which we ascribe to heaven: the fated sky
Gives us free scope, only doth backward pull
Our slow designs when we ourselves are dull.
What power is it which mounts my love so high,
That makes me see, and cannot feed mine eye?
The mightiest space in fortune nature brings
To join like likes and kiss like native things.
Impossible be strange attempts to those
That weigh their pains in sense and do suppose
What hath been cannot be: who ever strove
So show her merit, that did miss her love?
The king&apos;s disease--my project may deceive me,
But my intents are fix&apos;d and will not leave me.</string>

Take heed the queen come not within his sight;
For Oberon is passing fell and wrath,
Because that she as her attendant hath
A lovely boy, stolen from an Indian king;
She never had so sweet a changeling; 
And jealous Oberon would have the child
Knight of his train, to trace the forests wild;
But she perforce withholds the loved boy,
Crowns him with flowers and makes him all her joy:
And now they never meet in grove or green, 
By fountain clear, or spangled starlight sheen,
But, they do square, that all their elves for fear
Creep into acorn-cups and hide them there.</string>

		<string>Mislike me not for my complexion,
The shadow&apos;d livery of the burnish&apos;d sun,
To whom I am a neighbour and near bred.
Bring me the fairest creature northward born,
Where Phoebus&apos; fire scarce thaws the icicles,
And let us make incision for your love,
To prove whose blood is reddest, his or mine.
I tell thee, lady, this aspect of mine
Hath fear&apos;d the valiant: by my love I swear
The best-regarded virgins of our clime
Have loved it too: I would not change this hue,
Except to steal your thoughts, my gentle queen.

Therefore, I pray you, lead me to the caskets
To try my fortune. By this scimitar
That slew the Sophy and a Persian prince
That won three fields of Sultan Solyman,
I would outstare the sternest eyes that look,
Outbrave the heart most daring on the earth,
Pluck the young sucking cubs from the she-bear,
Yea, mock the lion when he roars for prey,
To win thee, lady. But, alas the while!
If Hercules and Lichas play at dice
Which is the better man, the greater throw
May turn by fortune from the weaker hand:
So is Alcides beaten by his page;
And so may I, blind fortune leading me,
Miss that which one unworthier may attain,
And die with grieving.</string>

		<string>You were ever good at sudden commendations,
Bishop of Winchester. But know, I come not
To hear such flattery now, and in my presence;
They are too thin and bare to hide offences.
To me you cannot reach, you play the spaniel,
And think with wagging of your tongue to win me;
But, whatsoe&apos;er thou takest me for, I&apos;m sure
Thou hast a cruel nature and a bloody
[to CRANMER]
Good man, sit down. Now let me see the proudest
He, that dares most, but wag his finger at thee:
By all that&apos;s holy, he had better starve
Than but once think this place becomes thee not.

[May it please your grace,--]

No, sir, it does not please me.
I had thought I had had men of some understanding
And wisdom of my council; but I find none.
Was it discretion, lords, to let this man,
This good man,--few of you deserve that title,--
This honest man, wait like a lousy footboy
At chamber--door? and one as great as you are?
Why, what a shame was this! Did my commission
Bid ye so far forget yourselves? I gave ye
Power as he was a counsellor to try him,
Not as a groom: there&apos;s some of ye, I see,
More out of malice than integrity,
Would try him to the utmost, had ye mean;
Which ye shall never have while I live.</string>

There was a haberdasher&apos;s wife of small wit near him, that railed upon me till her pinked porringer fell off her head, for kindling such a combustion in the state. I missed the meteor once, and hit that woman; who cried out &apos;Clubs!&apos; when I might see from far some forty truncheoners draw to her succor, which were the hope o&apos; the Strand, where she was quartered. They fell on; I made good my place: at length they came to the broom-staff to me; I defied &apos;em still: when suddenly a file of boys behind &apos;em, loose shot, delivered such a shower of pebbles, that I was fain to draw mine honour in, and let &apos;em win the work: the devil was amongst &apos;em, I think, surely.</string>

For heaven now bids me; and the words I utter
Let none think flattery, for they&apos;ll find &apos;em truth.
This royal infant--heaven still move about her!--
Though in her cradle, yet now promises
Upon this land a thousand thousand blessings,
Which time shall bring to ripeness: she shall be--
But few now living can behold that goodness--
A pattern to all princes living with her,
And all that shall succeed: Saba was never
More covetous of wisdom and fair virtue
Than this pure soul shall be: all princely graces,
That mould up such a mighty piece as this is,
With all the virtues that attend the good,
Shall still be doubled on her: truth shall nurse her,
Holy and heavenly thoughts still counsel her:
She shall be loved and fear&apos;d: her own shall bless her;
Her foes shake like a field of beaten corn,
And hang their heads with sorrow: good grows with her:
In her days every man shall eat in safety,
Under his own vine, what he plants; and sing
The merry songs of peace to all his neighbours:
God shall be truly known; and those about her
From her shall read the perfect ways of honour,
And by those claim their greatness, not by blood.
Nor shall this peace sleep with her: but as when
The bird of wonder dies, the maiden phoenix,
Her ashes new create another heir,
As great in admiration as herself;
So shall she leave her blessedness to one,
When heaven shall call her from this cloud of darkness,
Who from the sacred ashes of her honour
Shall star-like rise, as great in fame as she was,
And so stand fix&apos;d: peace, plenty, love, truth, terror,
That were the servants to this chosen infant,
Shall then be his, and like a vine grow to him:
Wherever the bright sun of heaven shall shine,
His honour and the greatness of his name
Shall be, and make new nations: he shall flourish,
And, like a mountain cedar, reach his branches
To all the plains about him: our children&apos;s children
Shall see this, and bless heaven.

[Thou speakest wonders.]

She shall be, to the happiness of England,
An aged princess; many days shall see her,
And yet no day without a deed to crown it.
Would I had known no more! but she must die,
She must, the saints must have her; yet a virgin,
A most unspotted lily shall she pass
To the ground, and all the world shall mourn her.</string>

Certainly the Jew is the very devil incarnal; and, in my conscience, my conscience is but a kind of hard conscience, to offer to counsel me to stay with the Jew. The fiend gives the more friendly counsel: I will run, fiend; my heels are at your command; I will run.</string>

		<string>Some god direct my judgment! Let me see;
I will survey the inscriptions back again.
What says this leaden casket?
&apos;Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath.&apos;
Must give: for what? for lead? hazard for lead?
This casket threatens. Men that hazard all
Do it in hope of fair advantages:
A golden mind stoops not to shows of dross;
I&apos;ll then nor give nor hazard aught for lead.
What says the silver with her virgin hue?
&apos;Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves.&apos;
As much as he deserves! Pause there, Morocco,
And weigh thy value with an even hand:
If thou be&apos;st rated by thy estimation,
Thou dost deserve enough; and yet enough
May not extend so far as to the lady:
And yet to be afeard of my deserving
Were but a weak disabling of myself.
As much as I deserve! Why, that&apos;s the lady:
I do in birth deserve her, and in fortunes,
In graces and in qualities of breeding;
But more than these, in love I do deserve.
What if I stray&apos;d no further, but chose here?
Let&apos;s see once more this saying graved in gold
&apos;Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire.&apos;
Why, that&apos;s the lady; all the world desires her;
From the four corners of the earth they come,
To kiss this shrine, this mortal-breathing saint:
The Hyrcanian deserts and the vasty wilds
Of wide Arabia are as thoroughfares now
For princes to come view fair Portia:
The watery kingdom, whose ambitious head
Spits in the face of heaven, is no bar
To stop the foreign spirits, but they come,
As o&apos;er a brook, to see fair Portia.
One of these three contains her heavenly picture.
Is&apos;t like that lead contains her? &apos;Twere damnation
To think so base a thought: it were too gross
To rib her cerecloth in the obscure grave.
Or shall I think in silver she&apos;s immured,
Being ten times undervalued to tried gold?
O sinful thought! Never so rich a gem
Was set in worse than gold. They have in England
A coin that bears the figure of an angel
Stamped in gold, but that&apos;s insculp&apos;d upon;
But here an angel in a golden bed
Lies all within. Deliver me the key:
Here do I choose, and thrive I as I may!

[He unlocks the golden casket]

O hell! what have we here?
A carrion Death, within whose empty eye
There is a written scroll! I&apos;ll read the writing.

[Reads]

All that glitters is not gold;
Often have you heard that told:
Many a man his life hath sold
But my outside to behold:
Gilded tombs do worms enfold.
Had you been as wise as bold,
Young in limbs, in judgment old,
Your answer had not been inscroll&apos;d:
Fare you well; your suit is cold.
Cold, indeed; and labour lost:
Then, farewell, heat, and welcome, frost!
Portia, adieu. I have too grieved a heart</string>

		<string>And so have I address&apos;d me. Fortune now
To my heart&apos;s hope! Gold; silver; and base lead.
&apos;Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath.&apos;
You shall look fairer, ere I give or hazard.
What says the golden chest? ha! let me see:
&apos;Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire.&apos;
What many men desire! that &apos;many&apos; may be meant
By the fool multitude, that choose by show,
Not learning more than the fond eye doth teach;
Which pries not to the interior, but, like the martlet,
Builds in the weather on the outward wall,
Even in the force and road of casualty.
I will not choose what many men desire,
Because I will not jump with common spirits
And rank me with the barbarous multitudes.
Why, then to thee, thou silver treasure-house;
Tell me once more what title thou dost bear:
&apos;Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves:&apos;
And well said too; for who shall go about
To cozen fortune and be honourable
Without the stamp of merit? Let none presume
To wear an undeserved dignity.
O, that estates, degrees and offices
Were not derived corruptly, and that clear honour
Were purchased by the merit of the wearer!
How many then should cover that stand bare!
How many be commanded that command!
How much low peasantry would then be glean&apos;d
From the true seed of honour! and how much honour
Pick&apos;d from the chaff and ruin of the times
To be new-varnish&apos;d! Well, but to my choice:
&apos;Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves.&apos;
I will assume desert. Give me a key for this,
And instantly unlock my fortunes here.

[He opens the silver casket]

What&apos;s here? the portrait of a blinking idiot,
Presenting me a schedule! I will read it.
How much unlike art thou to Portia!
How much unlike my hopes and my deservings!
&apos;Who chooseth me shall have as much as he deserves.&apos;
Did I deserve no more than a fool&apos;s head?
Is that my prize? are my deserts no better?
What is here?
[Reads]
The fire seven times tried this:
Seven times tried that judgment is,
That did never choose amiss.
Some there be that shadows kiss;
Such have but a shadow&apos;s bliss:
There be fools alive, I wis,
Silver&apos;d o&apos;er; and so was this.
Take what wife you will to bed,
I will ever be your head:
So be gone: you are sped.
Still more fool I shall appear
By the time I linger here
With one fool&apos;s head I came to woo,
But I go away with two.
Sweet, adieu. I&apos;ll keep my oath,
Patiently to bear my wroth.</string>

Before you hazard; for, in choosing wrong,
I lose your company: therefore forbear awhile.
There&apos;s something tells me, but it is not love,
I would not lose you; and you know yourself,
Hate counsels not in such a quality.
But lest you should not understand me well,--
And yet a maiden hath no tongue but thought,--
I would detain you here some month or two
Before you venture for me. I could teach you
How to choose right, but I am then forsworn;
So will I never be: so may you miss me;
But if you do, you&apos;ll make me wish a sin,
That I had been forsworn. Beshrew your eyes,
They have o&apos;erlook&apos;d me and divided me;
One half of me is yours, the other half yours,
Mine own, I would say; but if mine, then yours,
And so all yours. O, these naughty times
Put bars between the owners and their rights!
And so, though yours, not yours. Prove it so,
Let fortune go to hell for it, not I.
I speak too long; but &apos;tis to peize the time,
To eke it and to draw it out in length,
To stay you from election.</string>

Then, if he lose, he makes a swan-like end,
Fading in music: that the comparison
May stand more proper, my eye shall be the stream
And watery death-bed for him. He may win;
And what is music then? Then music is
Even as the flourish when true subjects bow
To a new-crowned monarch: such it is
As are those dulcet sounds in break of day
That creep into the dreaming bridegroom&apos;s ear,
And summon him to marriage. Now he goes,
With no less presence, but with much more love,
Than young Alcides, when he did redeem
The virgin tribute paid by howling Troy
To the sea-monster: I stand for sacrifice
The rest aloof are the Dardanian wives,
With bleared visages, come forth to view
The issue of the exploit. Go, Hercules!
Live thou, I live: with much, much more dismay
I view the fight than thou that makest the fray.</string>

		<string>So may the outward shows be least themselves:
The world is still deceived with ornament.
In law, what plea so tainted and corrupt,
But, being seasoned with a gracious voice,
Obscures the show of evil? In religion,
What damned error, but some sober brow
Will bless it and approve it with a text,
Hiding the grossness with fair ornament?
There is no vice so simple but assumes
Some mark of virtue on his outward parts:
How many cowards, whose hearts are all as false
As stairs of sand, wear yet upon their chins
The beards of Hercules and frowning Mars;
Who, inward search&apos;d, have livers white as milk;
And these assume but valour&apos;s excrement
To render them redoubted! Look on beauty,
And you shall see &apos;tis purchased by the weight;
Which therein works a miracle in nature,
Making them lightest that wear most of it:
So are those crisped snaky golden locks
Which make such wanton gambols with the wind,
Upon supposed fairness, often known
To be the dowry of a second head,
The skull that bred them in the sepulchre.
Thus ornament is but the guiled shore
To a most dangerous sea; the beauteous scarf
Veiling an Indian beauty; in a word,
The seeming truth which cunning times put on
To entrap the wisest. Therefore, thou gaudy gold,
Hard food for Midas, I will none of thee;
Nor none of thee, thou pale and common drudge
&apos;Tween man and man: but thou, thou meagre lead,
Which rather threatenest than dost promise aught,
Thy paleness moves me more than eloquence;
And here choose I; joy be the consequence!

What find I here?

[Opening the leaden casket]

Fair Portia&apos;s counterfeit! What demi-god
Hath come so near creation? Move these eyes?
Or whether, riding on the balls of mine,
Seem they in motion? Here are sever&apos;d lips,
Parted with sugar breath: so sweet a bar
Should sunder such sweet friends. Here in her hairs
The painter plays the spider and hath woven
A golden mesh to entrap the hearts of men,
Faster than gnats in cobwebs; but her eyes,--
How could he see to do them? having made one,
Methinks it should have power to steal both his
And leave itself unfurnish&apos;d. Yet look, how far
The substance of my praise doth wrong this shadow
In underprizing it, so far this shadow
Doth limp behind the substance. Here&apos;s the scroll,
The continent and summary of my fortune.

[Reads]
You that choose not by the view,
Chance as fair and choose as true!
Since this fortune falls to you,
Be content and seek no new,
If you be well pleased with this
And hold your fortune for your bliss,
Turn you where your lady is
And claim her with a loving kiss.
A gentle scroll. Fair lady, by your leave;
I come by note, to give and to receive.
Like one of two contending in a prize,
That thinks he hath done well in people&apos;s eyes,
Hearing applause and universal shout,
Giddy in spirit, still gazing in a doubt
Whether these pearls of praise be his or no;
So, thrice fair lady, stand I, even so;
As doubtful whether what I see be true,
Until confirm&apos;d, sign&apos;d, ratified by you.</string>

Such as I am: though for myself alone
I would not be ambitious in my wish,
To wish myself much better; yet, for you
I would be trebled twenty times myself;
A thousand times more fair, ten thousand times more rich;
That only to stand high in your account, 
I might in virtue, beauties, livings, friends,
Exceed account; but the full sum of me
Is sum of something, which, to term in gross,
Is an unlesson&apos;d girl, unschool&apos;d, unpractised;
Happy in this, she is not yet so old
But she may learn; happier than this,
She is not bred so dull but she can learn;
Happiest of all is that her gentle spirit
Commits itself to yours to be directed,
As from her lord, her governor, her king.
Myself and what is mine to you and yours
Is now converted: but now I was the lord
Of this fair mansion, master of my servants,
Queen o&apos;er myself: and even now, but now,
This house, these servants and this same myself
Are yours, my lord: I give them with this ring;
Which when you part from, lose, or give away,
Let it presage the ruin of your love
And be my vantage to exclaim on you.</string>

Sometime for three-foot stool mistaketh me.
Then slip I from her bum, down topples she,

And then the whole quire hold their hips and laugh,
And waxen in their mirth, and neeze, and swear
A merrier hour was never wasted there.

		<string>O sweet Portia,
Here are a few of the unpleasant&apos;st words
That ever blotted paper! Gentle lady,
When I did first impart my love to you,
I freely told you, all the wealth I had
Ran in my veins, I was a gentleman;
And then I told you true: and yet, dear lady,
Rating myself at nothing, you shall see
How much I was a braggart. When I told you
My state was nothing, I should then have told you
That I was worse than nothing; for, indeed,
I have engaged myself to a dear friend,
Engaged my friend to his mere enemy,
To feed my means. Here is a letter, lady;
The paper as the body of my friend,
And every word in it a gaping wound,
Issuing life-blood. But is it true, Salerio?
Have all his ventures fail&apos;d? What, not one hit?
From Tripolis, from Mexico and England,
From Lisbon, Barbary and India?
And not one vessel &apos;scape the dreadful touch
Of merchant-marring rocks?</string>

Double six thousand, and then treble that,
Before a friend of this description
Shall lose a hair through Bassanio&apos;s fault.
First go with me to church and call me wife,
And then away to Venice to your friend;
For never shall you lie by Portia&apos;s side
With an unquiet soul. You shall have gold
To pay the petty debt twenty times over:
When it is paid, bring your true friend along.
My maid Nerissa and myself meantime
Will live as maids and widows. Come, away!
For you shall hence upon your wedding-day:
Bid your friends welcome, show a merry cheer:
Since you are dear bought, I will love you dear.
But let me hear the letter of your friend.

O love, dispatch all business, and be gone!</string>

And speak between the change of man and boy
With a reed voice, and turn two mincing steps
Into a manly stride, and speak of frays
Like a fine bragging youth, and tell quaint lies,
How honourable ladies sought my love,
Which I denying, they fell sick and died;
I could not do withal; then I&apos;ll repent,
And wish for all that, that I had not killed them;
And twenty of these puny lies I&apos;ll tell,
That men shall swear I have discontinued school
Above a twelvemonth. I have within my mind
A thousand raw tricks of these bragging Jacks,

Shylock, the world thinks, and I think so too,
That thou but lead&apos;st this fashion of thy malice
To the last hour of act; and then &apos;tis thought
Thou&apos;lt show thy mercy and remorse more strange
Than is thy strange apparent cruelty;
And where thou now exact&apos;st the penalty,
Which is a pound of this poor merchant&apos;s flesh,
Thou wilt not only loose the forfeiture,
But, touch&apos;d with human gentleness and love,
Forgive a moiety of the principal;
Glancing an eye of pity on his losses,
That have of late so huddled on his back,
Enow to press a royal merchant down
And pluck commiseration of his state
From brassy bosoms and rough hearts of flint,
From stubborn Turks and Tartars, never train&apos;d
To offices of tender courtesy.
We all expect a gentle answer, Jew.</string>

		<string>I have possess&apos;d your grace of what I purpose;
And by our holy Sabbath have I sworn
To have the due and forfeit of my bond:
If you deny it, let the danger light
Upon your charter and your city&apos;s freedom.
You&apos;ll ask me, why I rather choose to have
A weight of carrion flesh than to receive
Three thousand ducats: I&apos;ll not answer that:
But, say, it is my humour: is it answer&apos;d?
What if my house be troubled with a rat
And I be pleased to give ten thousand ducats
To have it baned? What, are you answer&apos;d yet?
Some men there are love not a gaping pig;
Some, that are mad if they behold a cat;
And others, when the bagpipe sings i&apos; the nose,
Cannot contain their urine: for affection,
Mistress of passion, sways it to the mood
Of what it likes or loathes. Now, for your answer:
As there is no firm reason to be render&apos;d,
Why he cannot abide a gaping pig;
Why he, a harmless necessary cat;
Why he, a woollen bagpipe; but of force
Must yield to such inevitable shame
As to offend, himself being offended;
So can I give no reason, nor I will not,
More than a lodged hate and a certain loathing
I bear Antonio, that I follow thus
A losing suit against him. Are you answer&apos;d?</string>

		<string>The quality of mercy is not strain&apos;d,
It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven
Upon the place beneath: it is twice blest;
It blesseth him that gives and him that takes:
&apos;Tis mightiest in the mightiest: it becomes
The throned monarch better than his crown; 
His sceptre shows the force of temporal power,
The attribute to awe and majesty,
Wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings;
But mercy is above this sceptred sway;
It is enthroned in the hearts of kings,
It is an attribute to God himself;
And earthly power doth then show likest God&apos;s
When mercy seasons justice. Therefore, Jew,
Though justice be thy plea, consider this,
That, in the course of justice, none of us
Should see salvation: we do pray for mercy;
And that same prayer doth teach us all to render
The deeds of mercy. I have spoke thus much
To mitigate the justice of thy plea;
Which if thou follow, this strict court of Venice
Must needs give sentence &apos;gainst the merchant there.</string>

Grieve not that I am fallen to this for you;
For herein Fortune shows herself more kind
Than is her custom: it is still her use
To let the wretched man outlive his wealth,
To view with hollow eye and wrinkled brow
An age of poverty; from which lingering penance
Of such misery doth she cut me off.
Commend me to your honourable wife:
Tell her the process of Antonio&apos;s end;
Say how I loved you, speak me fair in death;
And, when the tale is told, bid her be judge
Whether Bassanio had not once a love.
Repent but you that you shall lose your friend,
And he repents not that he pays your debt;
For if the Jew do cut but deep enough,
I&apos;ll pay it presently with all my heart.</string>

The law hath yet another hold on you.
It is enacted in the laws of Venice,
If it be proved against an alien
That by direct or indirect attempts
He seek the life of any citizen,
The party &apos;gainst the which he doth contrive
Shall seize one half his goods; the other half
Comes to the privy coffer of the state;
And the offender&apos;s life lies in the mercy
Of the duke only, &apos;gainst all other voice.
In which predicament, I say, thou stand&apos;st;
For it appears, by manifest proceeding,
That indirectly and directly too
Thou hast contrived against the very life
Of the defendant; and thou hast incurr&apos;d
The danger formerly by me rehearsed.
Down therefore and beg mercy of the duke.</string>

		<string>How sweet the moonlight sleeps upon this bank!
Here will we sit and let the sounds of music
Creep in our ears: soft stillness and the night
Become the touches of sweet harmony.
Sit, Jessica. Look how the floor of heaven
Is thick inlaid with patines of bright gold:
There&apos;s not the smallest orb which thou behold&apos;st
But in his motion like an angel sings,
Still quiring to the young-eyed cherubins;
Such harmony is in immortal souls;
But whilst this muddy vesture of decay
Doth grossly close it in, we cannot hear it.

[Enter Musicians]

Come, ho! and wake Diana with a hymn!
With sweetest touches pierce your mistress&apos; ear,
And draw her home with music.

[Music]

[JESSICA: I am never merry when I hear sweet music.]

The reason is, your spirits are attentive:
For do but note a wild and wanton herd,
Or race of youthful and unhandled colts,
Fetching mad bounds, bellowing and neighing loud,
Which is the hot condition of their blood;
If they but hear perchance a trumpet sound,
Or any air of music touch their ears,
You shall perceive them make a mutual stand,
Their savage eyes turn&apos;d to a modest gaze
By the sweet power of music: therefore the poet
Did feign that Orpheus drew trees, stones and floods;
Since nought so stockish, hard and full of rage,
But music for the time doth change his nature.
The man that hath no music in himself,
Nor is not moved with concord of sweet sounds,
Is fit for treasons, stratagems and spoils;
The motions of his spirit are dull as night
And his affections dark as Erebus:
Let no such man be trusted. Mark the music.</string>

And how unwillingly I left the ring,
When nought would be accepted but the ring,
You would abate the strength of your displeasure.

No, by my honour, madam, by my soul,
No woman had it, but a civil doctor,
Which did refuse three thousand ducats of me
And begg&apos;d the ring; the which I did deny him
And suffer&apos;d him to go displeased away;
Even he that did uphold the very life
Of my dear friend. What should I say, sweet lady?
I was enforced to send it after him;
I was beset with shame and courtesy;
My honour would not let ingratitude
So much besmear it. Pardon me, good lady;
For, by these blessed candles of the night,
Had you been there, I think you would have begg&apos;d
The ring of me to give the worthy doctor.</string>

And never, since the middle summer’s spring,
Met we on hill, in dale, forest, or mead,
By pavèd fountain, or by rushy brook,
Or in the beachèd margent of the sea,
To dance our ringlets to the whistling wind,
But with thy brawls thou hast disturbed our sport.
Therefore the winds, piping to us in vain,
As in revenge, have sucked up from the sea
Contagious fogs, which falling in the land
Have every pelting river made so proud
That they have overborne their continents.
The ox hath therefore stretched his yoke in vain,
The ploughman lost his sweat, and the green corn
Hath rotted ere his youth attained a beard.
The fold stands empty in the drownèd field,
And crows are fatted with the murrain flock.
The nine-men’s-morris is filled up with mud,
And the quaint mazes in the wanton green
For lack of tread are undistinguishable.
The human mortals want their winter here.
No night is now with hymn or carol blessed.
Therefore the moon, the governess of floods,
Pale in her anger, washes all the air,
That rheumatic diseases do abound.
And thorough this distemperature we see
The seasons alter: hoary-headed frosts
Fall in the fresh lap of the crimson rose,
And on old Hiems&apos; thin and icy crown
An odorous chaplet of sweet summer buds
Is, as in mockery, set. The spring, the summer,
The childing autumn, angry winter change
Their wonted liveries, and the mazèd world,
By their increase, now knows not which is which.
And this same progeny of evils comes
From our debate, from our dissension.
We are their parents and original.</string>

I know a bank where the wild thyme blows,
Where oxlips and the nodding violet grows,
Quite over-canopied with luscious woodbine,
With sweet musk-roses and with eglantine:
There sleeps Titania sometime of the night,
Lull&apos;d in these flowers with dances and delight;
And there the snake throws her enamell&apos;d skin,
Weed wide enough to wrap a fairy in:
And with the juice of this I&apos;ll streak her eyes,
And make her full of hateful fantasies.
Take thou some of it, and seek through this grove:
A sweet Athenian lady is in love
With a disdainful youth: anoint his eyes;
But do it when the next thing he espies
May be the lady: thou shalt know the man
By the Athenian garments he hath on.
Effect it with some care, that he may prove
More fond on her than she upon her love:
And look thou meet me ere the first cock crow.</string>

		<string>O, I am out of breath in this fond chase!
The more my prayer, the lesser is my grace.
Happy is Hermia, wheresoe&apos;er she lies;
For she hath blessed and attractive eyes.
How came her eyes so bright? Not with salt tears:
If so, my eyes are oftener wash&apos;d than hers.
No, no, I am as ugly as a bear;
For beasts that meet me run away for fear:
Therefore no marvel though Demetrius
Do, as a monster fly my presence thus.
What wicked and dissembling glass of mine
Made me compare with Hermia&apos;s sphery eyne?
But who is here? Lysander! on the ground!
Dead? or asleep? I see no blood, no wound.
Lysander if you live, good sir, awake.</string>

[Awaking] And run through fire I will for thy sweet sake.
Transparent Helena! Nature shows art,
That through thy bosom makes me see thy heart.
Where is Demetrius? O, how fit a word
Is that vile name to perish on my sword!

[Do not say so, Lysander; say not so
What though he love your Hermia? Lord, what though?
Yet Hermia still loves you: then be content.]

Content with Hermia! No; I do repent
The tedious minutes I with her have spent.
Not Hermia but Helena I love:
Who will not change a raven for a dove?
The will of man is by his reason sway&apos;d;
And reason says you are the worthier maid.
Things growing are not ripe until their season
So I, being young, till now ripe not to reason;
And touching now the point of human skill,
Reason becomes the marshal to my will
And leads me to your eyes, where I o&apos;erlook
Love&apos;s stories written in love&apos;s richest book.</string>

Mine ear is much enamour&apos;d of thy note;
So is mine eye enthralled to thy shape;
And thy fair virtue&apos;s force perforce doth move me
On the first view to say, to swear, I love thee.

[Methinks, mistress, you should have little reason
for that: and yet, to say the truth, reason and
love keep little company together now-a-days; the
more the pity that some honest neighbours will not
make them friends. Nay, I can gleek upon occasion.]

Thou art as wise as thou art beautiful.

[Not so, neither: but if I had wit enough to get out
of this wood, I have enough to serve mine own turn.]

Out of this wood do not desire to go:
Thou shalt remain here, whether thou wilt or no.
I am a spirit of no common rate;
The summer still doth tend upon my state;
And I do love thee: therefore, go with me;
I&apos;ll give thee fairies to attend on thee,
And they shall fetch thee jewels from the deep,
And sing while thou on pressed flowers dost sleep;
And I will purge thy mortal grossness so
That thou shalt like an airy spirit go.

		<string>My mistress with a monster is in love.
Near to her close and consecrated bower,
While she was in her dull and sleeping hour,
A crew of patches, rude mechanicals,
That work for bread upon Athenian stalls,
Were met together to rehearse a play
Intended for great Theseus&apos; nuptial-day.
The shallowest thick-skin of that barren sort,
Who Pyramus presented, in their sport
Forsook his scene and enter&apos;d in a brake
When I did him at this advantage take,
An ass&apos;s nole I fixed on his head:
Anon his Thisbe must be answered,
And forth my mimic comes. When they him spy,
As wild geese that the creeping fowler eye,
Or russet-pated choughs, many in sort,
Rising and cawing at the gun&apos;s report,
Sever themselves and madly sweep the sky,
So, at his sight, away his fellows fly;
And, at our stamp, here o&apos;er and o&apos;er one falls;
He murder cries and help from Athens calls.
Their sense thus weak, lost with their fears
thus strong,
Made senseless things begin to do them wrong;
For briers and thorns at their apparel snatch;
Some sleeves, some hats, from yielders all
things catch.
I led them on in this distracted fear,
And left sweet Pyramus translated there:
When in that moment, so it came to pass,
Titania waked and straightway loved an ass.</string>

		<string>My gentle Puck, come hither. Thou rememberest
Since once I sat upon a promontory
And heard a mermaid on a dolphin’s back
Uttering such dulcet and harmonious breath
That the rude sea grew civil at her song
And certain stars shot madly from their spheres
To hear the seamaid’s music?

That very time I saw (but thou couldst not)
Flying between the cold moon and the Earth,
Cupid all armed. A certain aim he took
At a fair vestal thronèd by the west,
And loosed his love shaft smartly from his bow
As it should pierce a hundred thousand hearts.
But I might see young Cupid’s fiery shaft
Quenched in the chaste beams of the watery moon,
And the imperial votaress passèd on,
In maiden meditation, fancy-free.
Yet marked I where the bolt of Cupid fell.
It fell upon a little western flower,
Before milk-white, now purple with love’s wound.
And maidens call it “love-in-idleness.”
Fetch me that flower. The herb I showed thee once.
The juice of it on sleeping eyelids laid
Will make or man or woman madly dote
Upon the next live creature that it sees.
Fetch me this herb, and be thou here again
Ere the leviathan can swim a league.

Having once this juice,
I&apos;ll watch Titania when she is asleep,
And drop the liquor of it in her eyes.
The next thing then she waking looks upon,
Be it on lion, bear, or wolf, or bull,
On meddling monkey, or on busy ape,
She shall pursue it with the soul of love:
And ere I take this charm from off her sight,
As I can take it with another herb,
I&apos;ll make her render up her page to me.
But who comes here? I am invisible;
And I will overhear their conference.</string>

If you we re civil and knew courtesy,
You would not do me thus much injury.
Can you not hate me, as I know you do,
But you must join in souls to mock me too?
If you were men, as men you are in show,
You would not use a gentle lady so;
To vow, and swear, and superpraise my parts,
When I am sure you hate me with your hearts.
You both are rivals, and love Hermia;
And now both rivals, to mock Helena:
A trim exploit, a manly enterprise,
To conjure tears up in a poor maid&apos;s eyes
With your derision! none of noble sort
Would so offend a virgin, and extort
A poor soul&apos;s patience, all to make you sport.</string>

Hie therefore, Robin, overcast the night;
The starry welkin cover thou anon
With drooping fog as black as Acheron,
And lead these testy rivals so astray
As one come not within another&apos;s way.
Like to Lysander sometime frame thy tongue,
Then stir Demetrius up with bitter wrong;
And sometime rail thou like Demetrius;
And from each other look thou lead them thus,
Till o&apos;er their brows death-counterfeiting sleep
With leaden legs and batty wings doth creep:
Then crush this herb into Lysander&apos;s eye;
Whose liquor hath this virtuous property,
To take from thence all error with his might,
And make his eyeballs roll with wonted sight.
When they next wake, all this derision
Shall seem a dream and fruitless vision,
And back to Athens shall the lovers wend,
With league whose date till death shall never end.
Whiles I in this affair do thee employ,
I&apos;ll to my queen and beg her Indian boy;
And then I will her charmed eye release
From monster&apos;s view, and all things shall be peace.</string>

		<string>Welcome, good Robin.
See&apos;st thou this sweet sight?
Her dotage now I do begin to pity:
For, meeting her of late behind the wood,
Seeking sweet favours from this hateful fool,
I did upbraid her and fall out with her;
For she his hairy temples then had rounded
With a coronet of fresh and fragrant flowers;
And that same dew, which sometime on the buds
Was wont to swell like round and orient pearls,
Stood now within the pretty flowerets&apos; eyes
Like tears that did their own disgrace bewail.
When I had at my pleasure taunted her
And she in mild terms begg&apos;d my patience,
I then did ask of her her changeling child;
Which straight she gave me, and her fairy sent
To bear him to my bower in fairy land.
And now I have the boy, I will undo
This hateful imperfection of her eyes:
And, gentle Puck, take this transformed scalp
From off the head of this Athenian swain;
That, he awaking when the other do,
May all to Athens back again repair
And think no more of this night&apos;s accidents
But as the fierce vexation of a dream.
But first I will release the fairy queen.
Be as thou wast wont to be;
See as thou wast wont to see:
Dian&apos;s bud o&apos;er Cupid&apos;s flower
Hath such force and blessed power.
Now, my Titania; wake you, my sweet queen.</string>

But, my good lord, I wot not by what power,--
But by some power it is,--my love to Hermia,
Melted as the snow, seems to me now
As the remembrance of an idle gaud
Which in my childhood I did dote upon;
And all the faith, the virtue of my heart,
The object and the pleasure of mine eye,
Is only Helena. To her, my lord,
Was I betroth&apos;d ere I saw Hermia:
But, like in sickness, did I loathe this food;
But, as in health, come to my natural taste,
Now I do wish it, love it, long for it,
And will for evermore be true to it.</string>

		<string>More strange than true: I never may believe
These antique fables, nor these fairy toys.
Lovers and madmen have such seething brains,
Such shaping fantasies, that apprehend
More than cool reason ever comprehends.
The lunatic, the lover and the poet
Are of imagination all compact:
One sees more devils than vast hell can hold,
That is, the madman: the lover, all as frantic,
Sees Helen&apos;s beauty in a brow of Egypt:
The poet&apos;s eye, in fine frenzy rolling,
Doth glance from heaven to earth, from earth to heaven;
And as imagination bodies forth
The forms of things unknown, the poet&apos;s pen
Turns them to shapes and gives to airy nothing
A local habitation and a name.
Such tricks hath strong imagination,
That if it would but apprehend some joy,
It comprehends some bringer of that joy;
Or in the night, imagining some fear,
How easy is a bush supposed a bear!</string>

Our sport shall be to take what they mistake:
And what poor duty cannot do, noble respect
Takes it in might, not merit.
Where I have come, great clerks have purposed
To greet me with premeditated welcomes;
Where I have seen them shiver and look pale,
Make periods in the midst of sentences,
Throttle their practised accent in their fears
And in conclusion dumbly have broke off,
Not paying me a welcome. Trust me, sweet,
Out of this silence yet I pick&apos;d a welcome;
And in the modesty of fearful duty
I read as much as from the rattling tongue
Of saucy and audacious eloquence.
Love, therefore, and tongue-tied simplicity
In least speak most, to my capacity.</string>

		<string>Gentles, perchance you wonder at this show;
But wonder on, till truth make all things plain.
This man is Pyramus, if you would know;
This beauteous lady Thisby is certain.
This man, with lime and rough-cast, doth present
Wall, that vile Wall which did these lovers sunder;
And through Wall&apos;s chink, poor souls, they are content
To whisper. At the which let no man wonder.
This man, with lanthorn, dog, and bush of thorn,
Presenteth Moonshine; for, if you will know,
By moonshine did these lovers think no scorn
To meet at Ninus&apos; tomb, there, there to woo.
This grisly beast, which Lion hight by name,
The trusty Thisby, coming first by night,
Did scare away, or rather did affright;
And, as she fled, her mantle she did fall,
Which Lion vile with bloody mouth did stain.
Anon comes Pyramus, sweet youth and tall,
And finds his trusty Thisby&apos;s mantle slain:
Whereat, with blade, with bloody blameful blade,
He bravely broach&apos;d is boiling bloody breast;
And Thisby, tarrying in mulberry shade,
His dagger drew, and died. For all the rest,
Let Lion, Moonshine, Wall, and lovers twain
At large discourse, while here they do remain.</string>

		<string>Sweet Moon, I thank thee for thy sunny beams;
I thank thee, Moon, for shining now so bright;
For, by thy gracious, golden, glittering gleams,
I trust to take of truest Thisby sight.
But stay, O spite!
But mark, poor knight,
What dreadful dole is here!
Eyes, do you see?
How can it be?
O dainty duck! O dear!
Thy mantle good,
What, stain&apos;d with blood!
Approach, ye Furies fell!
O Fates, come, come,
Cut thread and thrum;
Quail, crush, conclude, and quell!

O wherefore, Nature, didst thou lions frame?
Since lion vile hath here deflower&apos;d my dear:
Which is--no, no--which was the fairest dame
That lived, that loved, that liked, that look&apos;d
with cheer.
Come, tears, confound;
Out, sword, and wound
The pap of Pyramus;
Ay, that left pap,
Where heart doth hop:

[Stabs himself]
Thus die I, thus, thus, thus.
Now am I dead,
Now am I fled;
My soul is in the sky:
Tongue, lose thy light;
Moon take thy flight:

Now die, die, die, die, die.</string>

O Pyramus, arise!
Speak, speak. Quite dumb?
Dead, dead? A tomb
Must cover thy sweet eyes.
These My lips,
This cherry nose,
These yellow cowslip cheeks,
Are gone, are gone:
Lovers, make moan:
His eyes were green as leeks.
O Sisters Three,
Come, come to me,
With hands as pale as milk;
Lay them in gore,
Since you have shore
With shears his thread of silk.
Tongue, not a word:
Come, trusty sword;
Come, blade, my breast imbrue:

[Stabs herself]

And, farewell, friends;
Thus Thisby ends:
Adieu, adieu, adieu.</string>

And the wolf behowls the moon;
Whilst the heavy ploughman snores,
All with weary task fordone.
Now the wasted brands do glow,
Whilst the screech-owl, screeching loud,
Puts the wretch that lies in woe
In remembrance of a shroud.
Now it is the time of night
That the graves all gaping wide,
Every one lets forth his sprite,
In the church-way paths to glide:
And we fairies, that do run
By the triple Hecate&apos;s team,
From the presence of the sun,
Following darkness like a dream,
Now are frolic: not a mouse
Shall disturb this hallow&apos;d house:

To sweep the dust behind the door.</string>

		<string>Lo, she is one of this confederacy!
Now I perceive they have conjoined all three
To fashion this false sport, in spite of me.—
Injurious Hermia! Most ungrateful maid!
Have you conspired, have you with these contrived
To bait me with this foul derision?
Is all the counsel that we two have shared,
The sisters&apos; vows, the hours that we have spent
When we have chid the hasty-footed time
For parting us—oh, is it all forgot?
All schooldays&apos; friendship, childhood innocence?
We, Hermia, like two artificial gods,
Have with our needles created both one flower,
Both on one sampler, sitting on one cushion,
Both warbling of one song, both in one key,
As if our hands, our sides, voices, and minds,
Had been incorporate. So we grew together,
Like to a double cherry—seeming parted
But yet an union in partition—
Two lovely berries molded on one stem;
So, with two seeming bodies but one heart,
Two of the first, like coats in heraldry,
Due but to one and crownèd with one crest.
And will you rent our ancient love asunder
To join with men in scorning your poor friend?
It is not friendly, ’tis not maidenly.
Our sex, as well as I, may chide you for it,
Though I alone do feel the injury.</string>

an oak but with one green leaf on it would have
answered her; my very visor began to assume life and
scold with her. She told me, not thinking I had been
myself, that I was the prince&apos;s jester, that I was
duller than a great thaw; huddling jest upon jest
with such impossible conveyance upon me that I stood
like a man at a mark, with a whole army shooting at
me. She speaks poniards, and every word stabs:
if her breath were as terrible as her terminations,
there were no living near her; she would infect to
the north star. I would not marry her, though she
were endowed with all that Adam bad left him before
he transgressed: she would have made Hercules have
turned spit, yea, and have cleft his club to make
the fire too. Come, talk not of her: you shall find
her the infernal Ate in good apparel. I would to God
some scholar would conjure her; for certainly, while
she is here, a man may live as quiet in hell as in a

would go thither; so, indeed, all disquiet, horror

		<string>I do much wonder that one man, seeing how much
another man is a fool when he dedicates his
behaviors to love, will, after he hath laughed at
such shallow follies in others, become the argument
of his own scorn by failing in love: and such a man
is Claudio. I have known when there was no music
with him but the drum and the fife; and now had he
rather hear the tabour and the pipe: I have known
when he would have walked ten mile a-foot to see a
good armour; and now will he lie ten nights awake,
carving the fashion of a new doublet. He was wont to
speak plain and to the purpose, like an honest man
and a soldier; and now is he turned orthography; his
words are a very fantastical banquet, just so many
strange dishes. May I be so converted and see with
these eyes? I cannot tell; I think not: I will not
be sworn, but love may transform me to an oyster; but
I&apos;ll take my oath on it, till he have made an oyster
of me, he shall never make me such a fool. One woman
is fair, yet I am well; another is wise, yet I am
well; another virtuous, yet I am well; but till all
graces be in one woman, one woman shall not come in
my grace. Rich she shall be, that&apos;s certain; wise,
or I&apos;ll none; virtuous, or I&apos;ll never cheapen her;
fair, or I&apos;ll never look on her; mild, or come not
near me; noble, or not I for an angel; of good
discourse, an excellent musician, and her hair shall
be of what colour it please God. Ha! the prince and
Monsieur Love! I will hide me in the arbour.</string>

this from Hero. They seem to pity the lady: it
seems her affections have their full bent. Love me!
why, it must be requited. I hear how I am censured:
they say I will bear myself proudly, if I perceive
the love come from her; they say too that she will
rather die than give any sign of affection. I did
never think to marry: I must not seem proud: happy
are they that hear their detractions and can put
them to mending. They say the lady is fair; &apos;tis a
truth, I can bear them witness; and virtuous; &apos;tis
so, I cannot reprove it; and wise, but for loving
me; by my troth, it is no addition to her wit, nor
no great argument of her folly, for I will be
horribly in love with her. I may chance have some
odd quirks and remnants of wit broken on me,
because I have railed so long against marriage: but
doth not the appetite alter? a man loves the meat
in his youth that he cannot endure in his age.
Shall quips and sentences and these paper bullets of
the brain awe a man from the career of his humour?
No, the world must be peopled. When I said I would

Behold how like a maid she blushes here!

And mine that I was proud on, mine so much

And salt too little which may season give

Change slander to remorse; that is some good:
But not for that dream I on this strange course,
But on this travail look for greater birth.
She dying, as it must so be maintain&apos;d,
Upon the instant that she was accused,
Shall be lamented, pitied and excused
Of every hearer: for it so falls out
That what we have we prize not to the worth
Whiles we enjoy it, but being lack&apos;d and lost,
Why, then we rack the value, then we find
The virtue that possession would not show us
Whiles it was ours. So will it fare with Claudio:
When he shall hear she died upon his words,
The idea of her life shall sweetly creep
Into his study of imagination,
And every lovely organ of her life
Shall come apparell&apos;d in more precious habit,
More moving-delicate and full of life,
Into the eye and prospect of his soul,
Than when she lived indeed; then shall he mourn,
If ever love had interest in his liver,
And wish he had not so accused her,
No, though he thought his accusation true.
Let this be so, and doubt not but success
Will fashion the event in better shape
Than I can lay it down in likelihood.
But if all aim but this be levell&apos;d false,
The supposition of the lady&apos;s death
Will quench the wonder of her infamy:
And if it sort not well, you may conceal her,
As best befits her wounded reputation,
In some reclusive and religious life,
Out of all eyes, tongues, minds and injuries.</string>

		<string>When my cue comes, call me, and I will answer. My next is “Most fair Pyramus.” Heigh-ho! Peter Quince? Flute the bellows-mender? Snout the tinker? Starveling? God’s my life, stol&apos;n hence, and left me asleep? I have had a most rare vision. I have had a dream—past the wit of man to say what dream it was. Man is but an ass if he go about to expound this dream. Methought I was—there is no man can tell what. Methought I was, and methought I had—but man is but a patched fool if he will offer to say what methought I had. The eye of man hath not heard, the ear of man hath not seen, man’s hand is not able to taste, his tongue to conceive, nor his heart to report what my dream was. I will get Peter Quince to write a ballad of this dream. It shall be called “Bottom’s Dream” because it hath no bottom. And I will sing it in the latter end of a play before the duke. Peradventure, to make it the more gracious, I shall sing it at her death.</string>

		<string>I pray thee, cease thy counsel,
Which falls into mine ears as profitless
As water in a sieve: give not me counsel;
Nor let no comforter delight mine ear
But such a one whose wrongs do suit with mine.
Bring me a father that so loved his child,
Whose joy of her is overwhelm&apos;d like mine,
And bid him speak of patience;
Measure his woe the length and breadth of mine
And let it answer every strain for strain,
As thus for thus and such a grief for such,
In every lineament, branch, shape, and form:
If such a one will smile and stroke his beard,
Bid sorrow wag, cry &apos;hem!&apos; when he should groan,
Patch grief with proverbs, make misfortune drunk
With candle-wasters; bring him yet to me,
And I of him will gather patience.
But there is no such man: for, brother, men
Can counsel and speak comfort to that grief
Which they themselves not feel; but, tasting it,
Their counsel turns to passion, which before
Would give preceptial medicine to rage,
Fetter strong madness in a silken thread,
Charm ache with air and agony with words:
No, no; &apos;tis all men&apos;s office to speak patience
To those that wring under the load of sorrow,
But no man&apos;s virtue nor sufficiency
To be so moral when he shall endure
The like himself. Therefore give me no counsel:
My griefs cry louder than advertisement.</string>

		<string>To sing a song that old was sung,
From ashes ancient Gower is come;
Assuming man&apos;s infirmities,
To glad your ear, and please your eyes.
It hath been sung at festivals,
On ember-eves and holy-ales;
And lords and ladies in their lives
Have read it for restoratives:
The purchase is to make men glorious;
Et bonum quo antiquius, eo melius.
If you, born in these latter times,
When wit&apos;s more ripe, accept my rhymes.
And that to hear an old man sing
May to your wishes pleasure bring
I life would wish, and that I might
Waste it for you, like taper-light.
This Antioch, then, Antiochus the Great
Built up, this city, for his chiefest seat:
The fairest in all Syria,
I tell you what mine authors say:
This king unto him took a fere,
Who died and left a female heir,
So buxom, blithe, and full of face,
As heaven had lent her all his grace;
With whom the father liking took,
And her to incest did provoke:
Bad child; worse father! to entice his own
To evil should be done by none:
But custom what they did begin
Was with long use account no sin.
The beauty of this sinful dame
Made many princes thither frame,
To seek her as a bed-fellow,
In marriage-pleasures play-fellow:
Which to prevent he made a law,
To keep her still, and men in awe,
That whoso ask&apos;d her for his wife,
His riddle told not, lost his life:
So for her many a wight did die,
As yon grim looks do testify.
What now ensues, to the judgment of your eye
I give, my cause who best can justify.</string>

		<string>Great king,
Few love to hear the sins they love to act;
&apos;Twould braid yourself too near for me to tell it.
Who has a book of all that monarchs do,
He&apos;s more secure to keep it shut than shown:
For vice repeated is like the wandering wind.
Blows dust in other&apos;s eyes, to spread itself;
And yet the end of all is bought thus dear,
The breath is gone, and the sore eyes see clear:
To stop the air would hurt them. The blind mole casts
Copp&apos;d hills towards heaven, to tell the earth is throng&apos;d
By man&apos;s oppression; and the poor worm doth die for&apos;t.
Kings are earth&apos;s gods; in vice their law&apos;s
their will;
And if Jove stray, who dares say Jove doth ill?
It is enough you know; and it is fit,
What being more known grows worse, to smother it.
All love the womb that their first being bred,
Then give my tongue like leave to love my head.</string>

		<string>How courtesy would seem to cover sin,
When what is done is like an hypocrite,
The which is good in nothing but in sight!
If it be true that I interpret false,
Then were it certain you were not so bad
As with foul incest to abuse your soul;
Where now you&apos;re both a father and a son,
By your untimely claspings with your child,
Which pleasure fits an husband, not a father;
And she an eater of her mother&apos;s flesh,
By the defiling of her parent&apos;s bed;
And both like serpents are, who though they feed
On sweetest flowers, yet they poison breed.
Antioch, farewell! for wisdom sees, those men
Blush not in actions blacker than the night,
Will shun no course to keep them from the light.
One sin, I know, another doth provoke;
Murder&apos;s as near to lust as flame to smoke:
Poison and treason are the hands of sin,
Ay, and the targets, to put off the shame:
Then, lest my lie be cropp&apos;d to keep you clear,
By flight I&apos;ll shun the danger which I fear.</string>

		<string>[To Lords without] Let none disturb us.--Why should
this change of thoughts,
The sad companion, dull-eyed melancholy,
Be my so used a guest as not an hour,
In the day&apos;s glorious walk, or peaceful night,
The tomb where grief should sleep, can breed me quiet?
Here pleasures court mine eyes, and mine eyes shun them,
And danger, which I fear&apos;d, is at Antioch,
Whose aim seems far too short to hit me here:
Yet neither pleasure&apos;s art can joy my spirits,
Nor yet the other&apos;s distance comfort me.
Then it is thus: the passions of the mind,
That have their first conception by mis-dread,
Have after-nourishment and life by care;
And what was first but fear what might be done,
Grows elder now and cares it be not done.
And so with me: the great Antiochus,
&apos;Gainst whom I am too little to contend,
Since he&apos;s so great can make his will his act,
Will think me speaking, though I swear to silence;
Nor boots it me to say I honour him.
If he suspect I may dishonour him:
And what may make him blush in being known,
He&apos;ll stop the course by which it might be known;
With hostile forces he&apos;ll o&apos;erspread the land,
And with the ostent of war will look so huge,
Amazement shall drive courage from the state;
Our men be vanquish&apos;d ere they do resist,
And subjects punish&apos;d that ne&apos;er thought offence:
Which care of them, not pity of myself,
Who am no more but as the tops of trees,
Which fence the roots they grow by and defend them,
Makes both my body pine and soul to languish,
And punish that before that he would punish.</string>

		<string>Thou speak&apos;st like a physician, Helicanus,
That minister&apos;st a potion unto me
That thou wouldst tremble to receive thyself.
Attend me, then: I went to Antioch,
Where as thou know&apos;st, against the face of death,
I sought the purchase of a glorious beauty.
From whence an issue I might propagate,
Are arms to princes, and bring joys to subjects.
Her face was to mine eye beyond all wonder;
The rest--hark in thine ear--as black as incest:
Which by my knowledge found, the sinful father
Seem&apos;d not to strike, but smooth: but thou
know&apos;st this,
&apos;Tis time to fear when tyrants seem to kiss.
Such fear so grew in me, I hither fled,
Under the covering of a careful night,
Who seem&apos;d my good protector; and, being here,
Bethought me what was past, what might succeed.
I knew him tyrannous; and tyrants&apos; fears
Decrease not, but grow faster than the years:
And should he doubt it, as no doubt he doth,
That I should open to the listening air
How many worthy princes&apos; bloods were shed,
To keep his bed of blackness unlaid ope,
To lop that doubt, he&apos;ll fill this land with arms,
And make pretence of wrong that I have done him:
When all, for mine, if I may call offence,
Must feel war&apos;s blow, who spares not innocence:
Which love to all, of which thyself art one,
Who now reprovest me for it,--

Drew sleep out of mine eyes, blood from my cheeks,
Musings into my mind, with thousand doubts
How I might stop this tempest ere it came;
And finding little comfort to relieve them,
I thought it princely charity to grieve them.</string>

		<string>O Dionyza,
Who wanteth food, and will not say he wants it,
Or can conceal his hunger till he famish?
Our tongues and sorrows do sound deep
Our woes into the air; our eyes do weep,
Till tongues fetch breath that may proclaim them louder;
That, if heaven slumber while their creatures want,
They may awake their helps to comfort them.
I&apos;ll then discourse our woes, felt several years,
And wanting breath to speak help me with tears.

This Tarsus, o&apos;er which I have the government,
A city on whom plenty held full hand,
For riches strew&apos;d herself even in the streets;
Whose towers bore heads so high they kiss&apos;d the clouds,
And strangers ne&apos;er beheld but wondered at;
Whose men and dames so jetted and adorn&apos;d,
Like one another&apos;s glass to trim them by:
Their tables were stored full, to glad the sight,
And not so much to feed on as delight;
All poverty was scorn&apos;d, and pride so great,
The name of help grew odious to repeat.

But see what heaven can do! By this our change,
These mouths, who but of late, earth, sea, and air,
Were all too little to content and please,
Although they gave their creatures in abundance,
As houses are defiled for want of use,
They are now starved for want of exercise:
Those palates who, not yet two summers younger,
Must have inventions to delight the taste,
Would now be glad of bread, and beg for it:
Those mothers who, to nousle up their babes,
Thought nought too curious, are ready now
To eat those little darlings whom they loved.
So sharp are hunger&apos;s teeth, that man and wife
Draw lots who first shall die to lengthen life:
Here stands a lord, and there a lady weeping;
Here many sink, yet those which see them fall
Have scarce strength left to give them burial.
Is not this true?</string>

Nor come we to add sorrow to your tears,
But to relieve them of their heavy load;
And these our ships, you happily may think
Are like the Trojan horse was stuff&apos;d within
With bloody veins, expecting overthrow,
Are stored with corn to make your needy bread,
And give them life whom hunger starved half dead.</string>

How Thaliard came full bent with sin
And had intent to murder him;
And that in Tarsus was not best
Longer for him to make his rest.

Where when men been, there&apos;s seldom ease;
For now the wind begins to blow;
Thunder above and deeps below
Make such unquiet, that the ship
Should house him safe is wreck&apos;d and split;
And he, good prince, having all lost,
By waves from coast to coast is tost:
All perishen of man, of pelf,
Ne aught escapen but himself;
Till fortune, tired with doing bad,
Threw him ashore, to give him glad:
And here he comes. What shall be next,

My brother Jaques he keeps at school, and report speaks goldenly of his profit: for my part, he keeps me rustically at home, or, to speak more properly, stays me here at home unkept; for call you that keeping for a gentleman of my birth, that differs not from the stalling of an ox? His horses are bred better; for, besides that they are fair with their feeding, they are taught their manage, and to that end riders dearly hired: but I, his brother, gain nothing under him but growth; for the which his animals on his dunghills are as much bound to him as I. Besides this nothing that he so plentifully gives me, the something that nature gave me his countenance seems to take from me: he lets me feed with his hinds, bars me the place of a brother, and, as much as in him lies, mines my gentility with my education. This is it, Adam, that grieves me; and the spirit of my father, which I think is within me, begins to mutiny against this servitude: I will no longer endure it, though yet I know no wise remedy how to avoid it.</string>

Thanks, fortune, yet, that, after all my crosses,
Thou givest me somewhat to repair myself;
And though it was mine own, part of my heritage,
Which my dead father did bequeath to me.
With this strict charge, even as he left his life,
&apos;Keep it, my Pericles; it hath been a shield
Twixt me and death;&apos;--and pointed to this brace;--
&apos;For that it saved me, keep it; in like necessity--
The which the gods protect thee from!--may
defend thee.&apos;
It kept where I kept, I so dearly loved it;
Till the rough seas, that spare not any man,
Took it in rage, though calm&apos;d have given&apos;t again:
I thank thee for&apos;t: my shipwreck now&apos;s no ill,
Since I have here my father&apos;s gift in&apos;s will.

To beg of you, kind friends, this coat of worth,
For it was sometime target to a king;
I know it by this mark. He loved me dearly,
And for his sake I wish the having of it;
And that you&apos;ld guide me to your sovereign&apos;s court,
Where with it I may appear a gentleman;
And if that ever my low fortune&apos;s better,
I&apos;ll pay your bounties; till then rest your debtor.</string>

		<string>By many a dern and painful perch
Of Pericles the careful search,
By the four opposing coigns
Which the world together joins,
Is made with all due diligence
That horse and sail and high expense
Can stead the quest. At last from Tyre,
Fame answering the most strange inquire,
To the court of King Simonides
Are letters brought, the tenor these:
Antiochus and his daughter dead;
The men of Tyrus on the head
Of Helicanus would set on
The crown of Tyre, but he will none:
The mutiny he there hastes t&apos; oppress;
Says to &apos;em, if King Pericles
Come not home in twice six moons,
He, obedient to their dooms,
Will take the crown. The sum of this,
Brought hither to Pentapolis,
Y-ravished the regions round,
And every one with claps can sound,
&apos;Our heir-apparent is a king!
Who dream&apos;d, who thought of such a thing?&apos;
Brief, he must hence depart to Tyre:
His queen with child makes her desire--
Which who shall cross?--along to go:
Omit we all their dole and woe:
Lychorida, her nurse, she takes,
And so to sea. Their vessel shakes
On Neptune&apos;s billow; half the flood
Hath their keel cut: but fortune&apos;s mood
Varies again; the grisly north
Disgorges such a tempest forth,
That, as a duck for life that dives,
So up and down the poor ship drives:
The lady shrieks, and well-a-near
Does fall in travail with her fear:
And what ensues in this fell storm
Shall for itself itself perform.
I nill relate, action may
Conveniently the rest convey;
Which might not what by me is told.
In your imagination hold
This stage the ship, upon whose deck
The sea-tost Pericles appears to speak.</string>

By turning o&apos;er authorities, I have,
Together with my practise, made familiar
To me and to my aid the blest infusions
That dwell in vegetives, in metals, stones;
And I can speak of the disturbances
That nature works, and of her cures; which doth give me
A more content in course of true delight
Than to be thirsty after tottering honour,
Or tie my treasure up in silken bags,
To please the fool and death.</string>

More a little, and then dumb.
This, my last boon, give me,
For such kindness must relieve me,
That you aptly will suppose
What pageantry, what feats, what shows,
What minstrelsy, and pretty din,
The regent made in Mytilene
To greet the king. So he thrived,
That he is promised to be wived
To fair Marina; but in no wise
Till he had done his sacrifice,
As Dian bade: whereto being bound,
The interim, pray you, all confound.
In feather&apos;d briefness sails are fill&apos;d,
And wishes fall out as they&apos;re will&apos;d.
At Ephesus, the temple see,
Our king and all his company.
That he can hither come so soon,
Is by your fancy&apos;s thankful doom.</string>

Then take him up and manage well the jest:
Carry him gently to my fairest chamber
And hang it round with all my wanton pictures:
Balm his foul head in warm distilled waters
And burn sweet wood to make the lodging sweet:
Procure me music ready when he wakes,
To make a dulcet and a heavenly sound;
And if he chance to speak, be ready straight
And with a low submissive reverence
Say &apos;What is it your honour will command?&apos;
Let one attend him with a silver basin
Full of rose-water and bestrew&apos;d with flowers,
Another bear the ewer, the third a diaper,
And say &apos;Will&apos;t please your lordship cool your hands?&apos;
Some one be ready with a costly suit
And ask him what apparel he will wear;
Another tell him of his hounds and horse,
And that his lady mourns at his disease:
Persuade him that he hath been lunatic;
And when he says he is, say that he dreams,
For he is nothing but a mighty lord.
This do and do it kindly, gentle sirs:
It will be pastime passing excellent,
If it be husbanded with modesty.</string>

That done, conduct him to the drunkard&apos;s chamber;

Tell him from me, as he will win my love,
He bear himself with honourable action,
Such as he hath observed in noble ladies
Unto their lords, by them accomplished:
Such duty to the drunkard let him do
With soft low tongue and lowly courtesy,
And say &apos;What is&apos;t your honour will command,
Wherein your lady and your humble wife
May show her duty and make known her love?&apos;
And then with kind embracements, tempting kisses,
And with declining head into his bosom,
Bid him shed tears, as being overjoy&apos;d
To see her noble lord restored to health,
Who for this seven years hath esteem&apos;d him
No better than a poor and loathsome beggar:
And if the boy have not a woman&apos;s gift
To rain a shower of commanded tears,
An onion will do well for such a shift,
Which in a napkin being close convey&apos;d
Shall in despite enforce a watery eye.

O noble lord, bethink thee of thy birth,
Call home thy ancient thoughts from banishment
And banish hence these abject lowly dreams.
Look how thy servants do attend on thee,
Each in his office ready at thy beck.
Wilt thou have music? hark! Apollo plays,

[Music]

And twenty caged nightingales do sing:
Or wilt thou sleep? we&apos;ll have thee to a couch
Softer and sweeter than the lustful bed
On purpose trimm&apos;d up for Semiramis.
Say thou wilt walk; we will bestrew the ground:
Or wilt thou ride? thy horses shall be trapp&apos;d,
Their harness studded all with gold and pearl.
Dost thou love hawking? thou hast hawks will soar
Above the morning lark or wilt thou hunt?
Thy hounds shall make the welkin answer them
And fetch shrill echoes from the hollow earth.</string>

And by my father&apos;s love and leave am arm&apos;d
With his good will and thy good company,
My trusty servant, well approved in all,
Here let us breathe and haply institute
A course of learning and ingenious studies.
Pisa renown&apos;d for grave citizens
Gave me my being and my father first,
A merchant of great traffic through the world,
Vincetino come of Bentivolii.
Vincetino&apos;s son brought up in Florence
It shall become to serve all hopes conceived,
To deck his fortune with his virtuous deeds:
And therefore, Tranio, for the time I study,
Virtue and that part of philosophy
Will I apply that treats of happiness
By virtue specially to be achieved.
Tell me thy mind; for I have Pisa left
And am to Padua come, as he that leaves
A shallow plash to plunge him in the deep
And with satiety seeks to quench his thirst.</string>

Hath not old custom made this life more sweet
Than that of painted pomp? Are not these woods
More free from peril than the envious court?
Here feel we but the penalty of Adam,
The seasons&apos; difference, as the icy fang
And churlish chiding of the winter&apos;s wind,
Which, when it bites and blows upon my body,
Even till I shrink with cold, I smile and say
&apos;This is no flattery: these are counsellors
That feelingly persuade me what I am.&apos;
Sweet are the uses of adversity,
Which, like the toad, ugly and venomous,
Wears yet a precious jewel in his head;
And this our life exempt from public haunt
Finds tongues in trees, books in the running brooks,
Sermons in stones and good in every thing.
I would not change it.

[Happy is your grace,
That can translate the stubbornness of fortune
Into so quiet and so sweet a style.]

Come, shall we go and kill us venison?
And yet it irks me the poor dappled fools,
Being native burghers of this desert city,
Should in their own confines with forked heads
Have their round haunches gored.</string>

Let&apos;s be no stoics nor no stocks, I pray;

Balk logic with acquaintance that you have
And practise rhetoric in your common talk;

I&apos;ll tell you, Sir Lucentio: when the priest
Should ask, if Katharina should be his wife,
&apos;Ay, by gogs-wouns,&apos; quoth he; and swore so loud,
That, all-amazed, the priest let fall the book;
And, as he stoop&apos;d again to take it up,
The mad-brain&apos;d bridegroom took him such a cuff
That down fell priest and book and book and priest:
&apos;Now take them up,&apos; quoth he, &apos;if any list.&apos;

Trembled and shook; for why, he stamp&apos;d and swore,
As if the vicar meant to cozen him.
But after many ceremonies done,
He calls for wine: &apos;A health!&apos; quoth he, as if
He had been aboard, carousing to his mates
After a storm; quaff&apos;d off the muscadel
And threw the sops all in the sexton&apos;s face;
Having no other reason
But that his beard grew thin and hungerly
And seem&apos;d to ask him sops as he was drinking.
This done, he took the bride about the neck
And kiss&apos;d her lips with such a clamorous smack
That at the parting all the church did echo:
And I seeing this came thence for very shame;
And after me, I know, the rout is coming.
Such a mad marriage never was before:
Hark, hark! I hear the minstrels play.</string>

		<string>They shall go forward, Kate, at thy command.
Obey the bride, you that attend on her;
Go to the feast, revel and domineer,
Carouse full measure to her maidenhead,
Be mad and merry, or go hang yourselves:
But for my bonny Kate, she must with me.
Nay, look not big, nor stamp, nor stare, nor fret;
I will be master of what is mine own:
She is my goods, my chattels; she is my house,
My household stuff, my field, my barn,
My horse, my ox, my ass, my any thing;
And here she stands, touch her whoever dare;
I&apos;ll bring mine action on the proudest he
That stops my way in Padua. Grumio,
Draw forth thy weapon, we are beset with thieves;
Rescue thy mistress, if thou be a man.
Fear not, sweet wench, they shall not touch
thee, Kate:
I&apos;ll buckler thee against a million.</string>

		<string>I have five hundred crowns,
The thrifty hire I saved under your father,
Which I did store to be my foster-nurse
When service should in my old limbs lie lame
And unregarded age in corners thrown:
Take that, and He that doth the ravens feed,
Yea, providently caters for the sparrow,
Be comfort to my age! Here is the gold;
And all this I give you. Let me be your servant:
Though I look old, yet I am strong and lusty;
For in my youth I never did apply
Hot and rebellious liquors in my blood,
Nor did not with unbashful forehead woo
The means of weakness and debility;
Therefore my age is as a lusty winter,
Frosty, but kindly: let me go with you;
I&apos;ll do the service of a younger man
In all your business and necessities.</string>

		<string>Thus have I politicly begun my reign,
And &apos;tis my hope to end successfully.
My falcon now is sharp and passing empty;
And till she stoop she must not be full-gorged,
For then she never looks upon her lure.
Another way I have to man my haggard,
To make her come and know her keeper&apos;s call,
That is, to watch her, as we watch these kites
That bate and beat and will not be obedient.
She eat no meat to-day, nor none shall eat;
Last night she slept not, nor to-night she shall not;
As with the meat, some undeserved fault
I&apos;ll find about the making of the bed;
And here I&apos;ll fling the pillow, there the bolster,
This way the coverlet, another way the sheets:
Ay, and amid this hurly I intend
That all is done in reverend care of her;
And in conclusion she shall watch all night:
And if she chance to nod I&apos;ll rail and brawl
And with the clamour keep her still awake.
This is a way to kill a wife with kindness;
And thus I&apos;ll curb her mad and headstrong humour.
He that knows better how to tame a shrew,
Now let him speak: &apos;tis charity to show.</string>

		<string>Fie, fie! unknit that threatening unkind brow,
And dart not scornful glances from those eyes,
To wound thy lord, thy king, thy governor:
It blots thy beauty as frosts do bite the meads,
Confounds thy fame as whirlwinds shake fair buds,
And in no sense is meet or amiable.
A woman moved is like a fountain troubled,
Muddy, ill-seeming, thick, bereft of beauty;
And while it is so, none so dry or thirsty
Will deign to sip or touch one drop of it.
Thy husband is thy lord, thy life, thy keeper,
Thy head, thy sovereign; one that cares for thee,
And for thy maintenance commits his body
To painful labour both by sea and land,
To watch the night in storms, the day in cold,
Whilst thou liest warm at home, secure and safe;
And craves no other tribute at thy hands
But love, fair looks and true obedience;
Too little payment for so great a debt.
Such duty as the subject owes the prince
Even such a woman oweth to her husband;
And when she is froward, peevish, sullen, sour,
And not obedient to his honest will,
What is she but a foul contending rebel
And graceless traitor to her loving lord?
I am ashamed that women are so simple
To offer war where they should kneel for peace;
Or seek for rule, supremacy and sway,
When they are bound to serve, love and obey.
Why are our bodies soft and weak and smooth,
Unapt to toil and trouble in the world,
But that our soft conditions and our hearts
Should well agree with our external parts?
Come, come, you froward and unable worms!
My mind hath been as big as one of yours,
My heart as great, my reason haply more,
To bandy word for word and frown for frown;
But now I see our lances are but straws,
Our strength as weak, our weakness past compare,
That seeming to be most which we indeed least are.
Then vail your stomachs, for it is no boot,
And place your hands below your husband&apos;s foot:
In token of which duty, if he please,
My hand is ready; may it do him ease.</string>

Now in the waist, the deck, in every cabin,
I flamed amazement: sometime I&apos;ld divide,
And burn in many places; on the topmast,
The yards and bowsprit, would I flame distinctly,
Then meet and join. Jove&apos;s lightnings, the precursors
O&apos; the dreadful thunder-claps, more momentary
And sight-outrunning were not; the fire and cracks
Of sulphurous roaring the most mighty Neptune
Seem to besiege and make his bold waves tremble,
Yea, his dread trident shake.

Not a soul
But felt a fever of the mad and play&apos;d
Some tricks of desperation. All but mariners
Plunged in the foaming brine and quit the vessel,
Then all afire with me: the king&apos;s son, Ferdinand,
With hair up-staring,--then like reeds, not hair,--
Was the first man that leap&apos;d; cried, &apos;Hell is empty
And all the devils are here.&apos;</string>

		<string>Virginity being blown down, man will quicklier be
blown up: marry, in blowing him down again, with
the breach yourselves made, you lose your city. It
is not politic in the commonwealth of nature to
preserve virginity. Loss of virginity is rational
increase and there was never virgin got till
virginity was first lost. That you were made of is
metal to make virgins. Virginity by being once lost
may be ten times found; by being ever kept, it is
ever lost: &apos;tis too cold a companion; away with &apos;t!

There&apos;s little can be said in &apos;t; &apos;tis against the
rule of nature. To speak on the part of virginity,
is to accuse your mothers; which is most infallible
disobedience. He that hangs himself is a virgin:
virginity murders itself and should be buried in
highways out of all sanctified limit, as a desperate
offendress against nature. Virginity breeds mites,
much like a cheese; consumes itself to the very
paring, and so dies with feeding his own stomach.
Besides, virginity is peevish, proud, idle, made of
self-love, which is the most inhibited sin in the
canon. Keep it not; you cannot choose but loose
by&apos;t: out with &apos;t! within ten year it will make
itself ten, which is a goodly increase; and the
principal itself not much the worse: away with &apos;t!</string>

		<string>All the world&apos;s a stage,
And all the men and women merely players:
They have their exits and their entrances;
And one man in his time plays many parts,
His acts being seven ages. At first the infant,
Mewling and puking in the nurse&apos;s arms.
And then the whining school-boy, with his satchel
And shining morning face, creeping like snail
Unwillingly to school. And then the lover,
Sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad
Made to his mistress&apos; eyebrow. Then a soldier,
Full of strange oaths and bearded like the pard,
Jealous in honour, sudden and quick in quarrel,
Seeking the bubble reputation
Even in the cannon&apos;s mouth. And then the justice,
In fair round belly with good capon lined,
With eyes severe and beard of formal cut,
Full of wise saws and modern instances;
And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts
Into the lean and slipper&apos;d pantaloon,
With spectacles on nose and pouch on side,
His youthful hose, well saved, a world too wide
For his shrunk shank; and his big manly voice,
Turning again toward childish treble, pipes
And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all,
That ends this strange eventful history,
Is second childishness and mere oblivion,
Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything.</string>

		<string>All the infections that the sun sucks up
From bogs, fens, flats, on Prosper fall and make him
By inch-meal a disease! His spirits hear me
And yet I needs must curse. But they&apos;ll nor pinch,
Fright me with urchin--shows, pitch me i&apos; the mire,
Nor lead me, like a firebrand, in the dark
Out of my way, unless he bid &apos;em; but
For every trifle are they set upon me;
Sometime like apes that mow and chatter at me
And after bite me, then like hedgehogs which
Lie tumbling in my barefoot way and mount
Their pricks at my footfall; sometime am I
All wound with adders who with cloven tongues
Do hiss me into madness.</string>

		<string>Here&apos;s neither bush nor shrub, to bear off
any weather at all, and another storm brewing;
I hear it sing i&apos; the wind: yond same black
cloud, yond huge one, looks like a foul
bombard that would shed his liquor. If it
should thunder as it did before, I know not
where to hide my head: yond same cloud cannot
choose but fall by pailfuls. What have we
here? a man or a fish? dead or alive? A fish:
he smells like a fish; a very ancient and fish-
like smell; a kind of not of the newest Poor-
John. A strange fish! Were I in England now,
as once I was, and had but this fish painted,
not a holiday fool there but would give a piece
of silver: there would this monster make a
man; any strange beast there makes a man:
when they will not give a doit to relieve a lame
beggar, they will lazy out ten to see a dead
Indian. Legged like a man and his fins like
arms! Warm o&apos; my troth! I do now let loose
my opinion; hold it no longer: this is no fish,
but an islander, that hath lately suffered by a
thunderbolt.

[Thunder]
Alas, the storm is come again! my best way is to
creep under his gaberdine; there is no other
shelter hereabouts: misery acquaints a man with
strange bed-fellows. I will here shroud till the
dregs of the storm be past.</string>

Delight in them sets off: some kinds of baseness
Are nobly undergone and most poor matters
Point to rich ends. This my mean task
Would be as heavy to me as odious, but
The mistress which I serve quickens what&apos;s dead
And makes my labours pleasures: O, she is
Ten times more gentle than her father&apos;s crabbed,
And he&apos;s composed of harshness. I must remove
Some thousands of these logs and pile them up,
Upon a sore injunction: my sweet mistress
Weeps when she sees me work, and says, such baseness
Had never like executor. I forget:
But these sweet thoughts do even refresh my labours,
Most busy lest, when I do it.</string>

I&apos; th&apos; afternoon to sleep: there thou mayst brain him,
Having first seized his books, or with a log
Batter his skull, or paunch him with a stake,
Or cut his wezand with thy knife. Remember
First to possess his books; for without them
He&apos;s but a sot, as I am, nor hath not
One spirit to command: they all do hate him
As rootedly as I. Burn but his books.
He has brave utensils,--for so he calls them--
Which when he has a house, he&apos;ll deck withal
And that most deeply to consider is
The beauty of his daughter; he himself
Calls her a nonpareil: I never saw a woman,
But only Sycorax my dam and she;
But she as far surpasseth Sycorax
As great&apos;st does least.

Ay, lord; she will become thy bed, I warrant.
And bring thee forth brave brood.</string>

That hath to instrument this lower world
And what is in&apos;t, the never-surfeited sea
Hath caused to belch up you; and on this island
Where man doth not inhabit; you &apos;mongst men
Being most unfit to live. I have made you mad;
And even with such-like valour men hang and drown
Their proper selves.

You fools! I and my fellows
Are ministers of Fate: the elements,
Of whom your swords are temper&apos;d, may as well
Wound the loud winds, or with bemock&apos;d-at stabs
Kill the still-closing waters, as diminish
One dowle that&apos;s in my plume: my fellow-ministers
Are like invulnerable. If you could hurt,
Your swords are now too massy for your strengths
And will not be uplifted. But remember--
For that&apos;s my business to you--that you three
From Milan did supplant good Prospero;
Exposed unto the sea, which hath requit it,
Him and his innocent child: for which foul deed
The powers, delaying, not forgetting, have
Incensed the seas and shores, yea, all the creatures,
Against your peace. Thee of thy son, Alonso,
They have bereft; and do pronounce by me:
Lingering perdition, worse than any death
Can be at once, shall step by step attend
You and your ways; whose wraths to guard you from--
Which here, in this most desolate isle, else falls
Upon your heads--is nothing but heart-sorrow
And a clear life ensuing.</string>

I ratify this my rich gift. O Ferdinand,
Do not smile at me that I boast her off,
For thou shalt find she will outstrip all praise
And make it halt behind her.

Then, as my gift and thine own acquisition
Worthily purchased take my daughter: but
If thou dost break her virgin-knot before
All sanctimonious ceremonies may
With full and holy rite be minister&apos;d,
No sweet aspersion shall the heavens let fall
To make this contract grow: but barren hate,
Sour-eyed disdain and discord shall bestrew
The union of your bed with weeds so loathly
That you shall hate it both: therefore take heed,
As Hymen&apos;s lamps shall light you.</string>

As if you were dismay&apos;d: be cheerful, sir.
Our revels now are ended. These our actors,
As I foretold you, were all spirits and
Are melted into air, into thin air:
And, like the baseless fabric of this vision,
The cloud-capp&apos;d towers, the gorgeous palaces,
The solemn temples, the great globe itself,
Ye all which it inherit, shall dissolve
And, like this insubstantial pageant faded,
Leave not a rack behind. We are such stuff
As dreams are made on, and our little life
Is rounded with a sleep. Sir, I am vex&apos;d;
Bear with my weakness; my, brain is troubled:
Be not disturb&apos;d with my infirmity:
If you be pleased, retire into my cell
And there repose: a turn or two I&apos;ll walk,
To still my beating mind.</string>

Have waked their sleepers, oped, and let &apos;em forth

		<string>Love is merely a madness, and, I tell you, deserves as well a dark house and a whip as madmen do: and the reason why they are not so punished and cured is, that the lunacy is so ordinary that the whippers are in love too. Yet I profess curing it by counsel.

[Did you ever cure any so?]

Yes, one, and in this manner. He was to imagine me his love, his mistress; and I set him every day to woo me: at which time would I, being but a moonish youth, grieve, be effeminate, changeable, longing and liking, proud, fantastical, apish, shallow, inconstant, full of tears, full of smiles, for every passion something and for no passion truly any thing, as boys and women are for the most part cattle of this colour; would now like him, now loathe him; then entertain him, then forswear him; now weep for him, then spit at him; that I drave my suitor from his mad humour of love to a living humour of madness; which was, to forswear the full stream of the world, and to live in a nook merely monastic. And thus I cured him; and this way will I take upon me to wash your liver as clean as a sound sheep&apos;s heart, that there shall not be one spot of love in&apos;t.

[I would not be cured, youth.]

I would cure you, if you would but call me Rosalind and come every day to my cote and woo me.</string>

Mine eyes, even sociable to the show of thine,
Fall fellowly drops. The charm dissolves apace,
And as the morning steals upon the night,
Melting the darkness, so their rising senses
Begin to chase the ignorant fumes that mantle
Their clearer reason. O good Gonzalo,
My true preserver, and a loyal sir
To him you follow&apos;st! I will pay thy graces
Home both in word and deed. Most cruelly
Didst thou, Alonso, use me and my daughter:
Thy brother was a furtherer in the act.
Thou art pinch&apos;d fort now, Sebastian. Flesh and blood,
You, brother mine, that entertain&apos;d ambition,
Expell&apos;d remorse and nature; who, with Sebastian,
Whose inward pinches therefore are most strong,
Would here have kill&apos;d your king; I do forgive thee,
Unnatural though thou art. Their understanding
Begins to swell, and the approaching tide
Will shortly fill the reasonable shore
That now lies foul and muddy. Not one of them
That yet looks on me, or would know me Ariel,
Fetch me the hat and rapier in my cell:

As I was sometime Milan: quickly, spirit;

		<string>O Pandarus! I tell thee, Pandarus,--
When I do tell thee, there my hopes lie drown&apos;d,
Reply not in how many fathoms deep
They lie indrench&apos;d. I tell thee I am mad
In Cressid&apos;s love: thou answer&apos;st &apos;she is fair;&apos;
Pour&apos;st in the open ulcer of my heart
Her eyes, her hair, her cheek, her gait, her voice,
Handlest in thy discourse, O, that her hand,
In whose comparison all whites are ink,
Writing their own reproach, to whose soft seizure
The cygnet&apos;s down is harsh and spirit of sense
Hard as the palm of ploughman: this thou tell&apos;st me,
As true thou tell&apos;st me, when I say I love her;
But, saying thus, instead of oil and balm,
Thou lay&apos;st in every gash that love hath given me
The knife that made it.</string>

		<string>Peace, you ungracious clamours! peace, rude sounds!
Fools on both sides! Helen must needs be fair,
When with your blood you daily paint her thus.
I cannot fight upon this argument;
It is too starved a subject for my sword.
But Pandarus,--O gods, how do you plague me!
I cannot come to Cressid but by Pandar;
And he&apos;s as tetchy to be woo&apos;d to woo.
As she is stubborn-chaste against all suit.
Tell me, Apollo, for thy Daphne&apos;s love,
What Cressid is, what Pandar, and what we?
Her bed is India; there she lies, a pearl:
Between our Ilium and where she resides,
Let it be call&apos;d the wild and wandering flood,
Ourself the merchant, and this sailing Pandar
Our doubtful hope, our convoy and our bark.</string>

		<string>The noise goes, this: there is among the Greeks
A lord of Trojan blood, nephew to Hector;
They call him Ajax.

[Good; and what of him?]

They say he is a very man per se,
And stands alone.

[So do all men, unless they are drunk, sick, or have no legs.]

This man, lady, hath robbed many beasts of their particular additions; he is as valiant as the lion, churlish as the bear, slow as the elephant: a man into whom nature hath so crowded humours that his valour is crushed into folly, his folly sauced with discretion: there is no man hath a virtue that he hath not a glimpse of, nor any man an attaint but he carries some stain of it: he is melancholy without cause, and merry against the hair: he hath the joints of every thing, but everything so out of joint that he is a gouty Briareus, many hands and no use, or purblind Argus, all eyes and no sight.

[But how should this man, that makes me smile, make Hector angry?]

They say he yesterday coped Hector in the battle and struck him down, the disdain and shame whereof hath ever since kept Hector fasting and waking.</string>

He offers in another&apos;s enterprise;
But more in Troilus thousand fold I see
Than in the glass of Pandar&apos;s praise may be;
Yet hold I off. Women are angels, wooing:
Things won are done; joy&apos;s soul lies in the doing.
That she beloved knows nought that knows not this:
Men prize the thing ungain&apos;d more than it is:
That she was never yet that ever knew
Love got so sweet as when desire did sue.
Therefore this maxim out of love I teach:
Achievement is command; ungain&apos;d, beseech:
Then though my heart&apos;s content firm love doth bear,
Nothing of that shall from mine eyes appear.</string>

		<string>Princes,
What grief hath set the jaundice on your cheeks?
The ample proposition that hope makes
In all designs begun on earth below
Fails in the promised largeness: cheques and disasters
Grow in the veins of actions highest rear&apos;d,
As knots, by the conflux of meeting sap,
Infect the sound pine and divert his grain
Tortive and errant from his course of growth.
Nor, princes, is it matter new to us
That we come short of our suppose so far
That after seven years&apos; siege yet Troy walls stand;
Sith every action that hath gone before,
Whereof we have record, trial did draw
Bias and thwart, not answering the aim,
And that unbodied figure of the thought
That gave&apos;t surmised shape. Why then, you princes,
Do you with cheeks abash&apos;d behold our works,
And call them shames? which are indeed nought else
But the protractive trials of great Jove
To find persistive constancy in men:
The fineness of which metal is not found
In fortune&apos;s love; for then the bold and coward,
The wise and fool, the artist and unread,
The hard and soft seem all affined and kin:
But, in the wind and tempest of her frown,
Distinction, with a broad and powerful fan,
Puffing at all, winnows the light away;
And what hath mass or matter, by itself
Lies rich in virtue and unmingled.</string>

How many shallow bauble boats dare sail
Upon her patient breast, making their way
With those of nobler bulk!
But let the ruffian Boreas once enrage
The gentle Thetis, and anon behold
The strong-ribb&apos;d bark through liquid mountains cut,
Bounding between the two moist elements,
Like Perseus&apos; horse: where&apos;s then the saucy boat
Whose weak untimber&apos;d sides but even now
Co-rivall&apos;d greatness? Either to harbour fled,
Or made a toast for Neptune. Even so
Doth valour&apos;s show and valour&apos;s worth divide
In storms of fortune; for in her ray and brightness
The herd hath more annoyance by the breeze
Than by the tiger; but when the splitting wind
Makes flexible the knees of knotted oaks,
And flies fled under shade, why, then the thing of courage
As roused with rage with rage doth sympathize,
And with an accent tuned in selfsame key
Retorts to chiding fortune.</string>

		<string>Troy, yet upon his basis, had been down,
And the great Hector&apos;s sword had lack&apos;d a master,
But for these instances.
The specialty of rule hath been neglected:
And, look, how many Grecian tents do stand
Hollow upon this plain, so many hollow factions.
When that the general is not like the hive
To whom the foragers shall all repair,
What honey is expected? Degree being vizarded,
The unworthiest shows as fairly in the mask.
The heavens themselves, the planets and this centre
Observe degree, priority and place,
Insisture, course, proportion, season, form,
Office and custom, in all line of order;
And therefore is the glorious planet Sol
In noble eminence enthroned and sphered
Amidst the other; whose medicinable eye
Corrects the ill aspects of planets evil,
And posts, like the commandment of a king,
Sans cheque to good and bad: but when the planets
In evil mixture to disorder wander,
What plagues and what portents! what mutiny!
What raging of the sea! shaking of earth!
Commotion in the winds! frights, changes, horrors,
Divert and crack, rend and deracinate
The unity and married calm of states
Quite from their fixure! O, when degree is shaked,
Which is the ladder to all high designs,
Then enterprise is sick! How could communities,
Degrees in schools and brotherhoods in cities,
Peaceful commerce from dividable shores,
The primogenitive and due of birth,
Prerogative of age, crowns, sceptres, laurels,
But by degree, stand in authentic place?
Take but degree away, untune that string,
And, hark, what discord follows! each thing meets
In mere oppugnancy: the bounded waters
Should lift their bosoms higher than the shores
And make a sop of all this solid globe:
Strength should be lord of imbecility,
And the rude son should strike his father dead:
Force should be right; or rather, right and wrong,
Between whose endless jar justice resides,
Should lose their names, and so should justice too.
Then every thing includes itself in power,
Power into will, will into appetite;
And appetite, an universal wolf,
So doubly seconded with will and power,
Must make perforce an universal prey,
And last eat up himself. Great Agamemnon,
This chaos, when degree is suffocate,
Follows the choking.
And this neglection of degree it is
That by a pace goes backward, with a purpose
It hath to climb. The general&apos;s disdain&apos;d
By him one step below, he by the next,
That next by him beneath; so every step,
Exampled by the first pace that is sick
Of his superior, grows to an envious fever
Of pale and bloodless emulation:
And &apos;tis this fever that keeps Troy on foot,
Not her own sinews. To end a tale of length,
Troy in our weakness stands, not in her strength.</string>

Well, that is the dowry of his wife; &apos;tis none of his own getting. Horns? Even so. Poor men alone? No, no; the noblest deer hath them as huge as the rascal. Is the single man therefore blessed? No: as a walled town is more worthier than a village, so is the forehead of a married man more honourable than the bare brow of a bachelor; and by how much defence is better than no skill, by so much is a horn more precious than to want.</string>

		<string>The great Achilles, whom opinion crowns
The sinew and the forehand of our host,
Having his ear full of his airy fame,
Grows dainty of his worth, and in his tent
Lies mocking our designs: with him Patroclus
Upon a lazy bed the livelong day
Breaks scurril jests;
And with ridiculous and awkward action,
Which, slanderer, he imitation calls,
He pageants us. Sometime, great Agamemnon,
Thy topless deputation he puts on,
And, like a strutting player, whose conceit
Lies in his hamstring, and doth think it rich
To hear the wooden dialogue and sound
&apos;Twixt his stretch&apos;d footing and the scaffoldage,--
Such to-be-pitied and o&apos;er-wrested seeming
He acts thy greatness in: and when he speaks,
&apos;Tis like a chime a-mending; with terms unsquared,
Which, from the tongue of roaring Typhon dropp&apos;d
Would seem hyperboles. At this fusty stuff
The large Achilles, on his press&apos;d bed lolling,
From his deep chest laughs out a loud applause;
Cries &apos;Excellent! &apos;tis Agamemnon just.
Now play me Nestor; hem, and stroke thy beard,
As he being drest to some oration.&apos;
That&apos;s done, as near as the extremest ends
Of parallels, as like as Vulcan and his wife:
Yet god Achilles still cries &apos;Excellent!
&apos;Tis Nestor right. Now play him me, Patroclus,
Arming to answer in a night alarm.&apos;
And then, forsooth, the faint defects of age
Must be the scene of mirth; to cough and spit,
And, with a palsy-fumbling on his gorget,
Shake in and out the rivet: and at this sport
Sir Valour dies; cries &apos;O, enough, Patroclus;
Or give me ribs of steel! I shall split all
In pleasure of my spleen.&apos; And in this fashion,
All our abilities, gifts, natures, shapes,
Severals and generals of grace exact,
Achievements, plots, orders, preventions,
Excitements to the field, or speech for truce,
Success or loss, what is or is not, serves
As stuff for these two to make paradoxes.</string>

[Trumpet sounds]

We have, great Agamemnon, here in Troy
A prince call&apos;d Hector,--Priam is his father,--
Who in this dull and long-continued truce
Is rusty grown: he bade me take a trumpet,
And to this purpose speak. Kings, princes, lords!
If there be one among the fair&apos;st of Greece
That holds his honour higher than his ease,
That seeks his praise more than he fears his peril,
That knows his valour, and knows not his fear,
That loves his mistress more than in confession,
With truant vows to her own lips he loves,
And dare avow her beauty and her worth
In other arms than hers,--to him this challenge.
Hector, in view of Trojans and of Greeks,
Shall make it good, or do his best to do it,
He hath a lady, wiser, fairer, truer,
Than ever Greek did compass in his arms,
And will to-morrow with his trumpet call
Midway between your tents and walls of Troy,
To rouse a Grecian that is true in love:
If any come, Hector shall honour him;
If none, he&apos;ll say in Troy when he retires,
The Grecian dames are sunburnt and not worth
The splinter of a lance. Even so much.</string>

That can from Hector bring his honour off,
If not Achilles? Though&apos;t be a sportful combat,

For here the Trojans taste our dear&apos;st repute
With their finest palate: and trust to me, Ulysses,
Our imputation shall be oddly poised
In this wild action; for the success,
Although particular, shall give a scantling
Of good or bad unto the general;
And in such indexes, although small pricks
To their subsequent volumes, there is seen
The baby figure of the giant mass
Of things to come at large. It is supposed
He that meets Hector issues from our choice
And choice, being mutual act of all our souls,
Makes merit her election, and doth boil,
As &apos;twere from us all, a man distill&apos;d
Out of our virtues; who miscarrying,
What heart receives from hence the conquering part,
To steel a strong opinion to themselves?
Which entertain&apos;d, limbs are his instruments,
In no less working than are swords and bows
Directive by the limbs.</string>

As far as toucheth my particular,
Yet, dread Priam,
There is no lady of more softer bowels,
More spongy to suck in the sense of fear,
More ready to cry out &apos;Who knows what follows?&apos;
Than Hector is: the wound of peace is surety,
Surety secure; but modest doubt is call&apos;d
The beacon of the wise, the tent that searches
To the bottom of the worst. Let Helen go:
Since the first sword was drawn about this question,
Every tithe soul, &apos;mongst many thousand dismes,
Hath been as dear as Helen; I mean, of ours:
If we have lost so many tenths of ours,
To guard a thing not ours nor worth to us,
Had it our name, the value of one ten,
What merit&apos;s in that reason which denies
The yielding of her up?</string>

		<string>You are for dreams and slumbers, brother priest;
You fur your gloves with reason. Here are
your reasons:
You know an enemy intends you harm;
You know a sword employ&apos;d is perilous,
And reason flies the object of all harm:
Who marvels then, when Helenus beholds
A Grecian and his sword, if he do set
The very wings of reason to his heels
And fly like chidden Mercury from Jove,
Or like a star disorb&apos;d? Nay, if we talk of reason,
Let&apos;s shut our gates and sleep: manhood and honour
Should have hare-hearts, would they but fat
their thoughts
With this cramm&apos;d reason: reason and respect
Make livers pale and lustihood deject.</string>

		<string>I take to-day a wife, and my election
Is led on in the conduct of my will;
My will enkindled by mine eyes and ears,
Two traded pilots &apos;twixt the dangerous shores
Of will and judgment: how may I avoid,
Although my will distaste what it elected,
The wife I chose? there can be no evasion
To blench from this and to stand firm by honour:
We turn not back the silks upon the merchant,
When we have soil&apos;d them, nor the remainder viands
We do not throw in unrespective sieve,
Because we now are full. It was thought meet
Paris should do some vengeance on the Greeks:
Your breath of full consent bellied his sails;
The seas and winds, old wranglers, took a truce
And did him service: he touch&apos;d the ports desired,
And for an old aunt whom the Greeks held captive,
He brought a Grecian queen, whose youth and freshness
Wrinkles Apollo&apos;s, and makes stale the morning.
Why keep we her? the Grecians keep our aunt:
Is she worth keeping? why, she is a pearl,
Whose price hath launch&apos;d above a thousand ships,
And turn&apos;d crown&apos;d kings to merchants.
If you&apos;ll avouch &apos;twas wisdom Paris went--
As you must needs, for you all cried &apos;Go, go,&apos;--
If you&apos;ll confess he brought home noble prize--
As you must needs, for you all clapp&apos;d your hands
And cried &apos;Inestimable!&apos;--why do you now
The issue of your proper wisdoms rate,
And do a deed that fortune never did,
Beggar the estimation which you prized
Richer than sea and land? O, theft most base,
That we have stol&apos;n what we do fear to keep!
But, thieves, unworthy of a thing so stol&apos;n,
That in their country did them that disgrace,
We fear to warrant in our native place!</string>

The pleasures such a beauty brings with it;

Wiped off, in honourable keeping her.
What treason were it to the ransack&apos;d queen,
Disgrace to your great worths and shame to me,
Now to deliver her possession up
On terms of base compulsion! Can it be
That so degenerate a strain as this
Should once set footing in your generous bosoms?
There&apos;s not the meanest spirit on our party
Without a heart to dare or sword to draw
When Helen is defended, nor none so noble
Whose life were ill bestow&apos;d or death unfamed
Where Helen is the subject; then, I say,
Well may we fight for her whom, we know well,
The world&apos;s large spaces cannot parallel.</string>

		<string>Paris and Troilus, you have both said well,
And on the cause and question now in hand
Have glozed, but superficially: not much
Unlike young men, whom Aristotle thought
Unfit to hear moral philosophy:
The reasons you allege do more conduce
To the hot passion of distemper&apos;d blood
Than to make up a free determination
&apos;Twixt right and wrong, for pleasure and revenge
Have ears more deaf than adders to the voice
Of any true decision. Nature craves
All dues be render&apos;d to their owners: now,
What nearer debt in all humanity
Than wife is to the husband? If this law
Of nature be corrupted through affection,
And that great minds, of partial indulgence
To their benumbed wills, resist the same,
There is a law in each well-order&apos;d nation
To curb those raging appetites that are
Most disobedient and refractory.
If Helen then be wife to Sparta&apos;s king,
As it is known she is, these moral laws
Of nature and of nations speak aloud
To have her back return&apos;d: thus to persist
In doing wrong extenuates not wrong,
But makes it much more heavy. Hector&apos;s opinion
Is this in way of truth; yet ne&apos;ertheless,
My spritely brethren, I propend to you
In resolution to keep Helen still,
For &apos;tis a cause that hath no mean dependance
Upon our joint and several dignities.</string>

Thou tell&apos;st me there is murder in mine eye:
&apos;Tis pretty, sure, and very probable,
That eyes, that are the frail&apos;st and softest things,
Who shut their coward gates on atomies,
Should be call&apos;d tyrants, butchers, murderers!
Now I do frown on thee with all my heart;
And if mine eyes can wound, now let them kill thee:
Now counterfeit to swoon; why now fall down;
Or if thou canst not, O, for shame, for shame,
Lie not, to say mine eyes are murderers!
Now show the wound mine eye hath made in thee:
Scratch thee but with a pin, and there remains
Some scar of it; lean but upon a rush,
The cicatrice and capable impressure
Thy palm some moment keeps; but now mine eyes,
Which I have darted at thee, hurt thee not,
Nor, I am sure, there is no force in eyes
That can do hurt.</string>

We are too well acquainted with these answers:
But his evasion, wing&apos;d thus swift with scorn,
Cannot outfly our apprehensions.
Much attribute he hath, and much the reason
Why we ascribe it to him; yet all his virtues,
Not virtuously on his own part beheld,
Do in our eyes begin to lose their gloss,
Yea, like fair fruit in an unwholesome dish,
Are like to rot untasted. Go and tell him,
We come to speak with him; and you shall not sin,
If you do say we think him over-proud
And under-honest, in self-assumption greater
Than in the note of judgment; and worthier
than himself
Here tend the savage strangeness he puts on,
Disguise the holy strength of their command,
And underwrite in an observing kind
His humorous predominance; yea, watch
His pettish lunes, his ebbs, his flows, as if
The passage and whole carriage of this action
Rode on his tide. Go tell him this, and add,
That if he overhold his price so much,
We&apos;ll none of him; but let him, like an engine
Not portable, lie under this report:
&apos;Bring action hither, this cannot go to war:
A stirring dwarf we do allowance give
Before a sleeping giant.&apos; Tell him so.</string>

		<string>Now, princes, for the service I have done you,
The advantage of the time prompts me aloud
To call for recompense. Appear it to your mind
That, through the sight I bear in things to love,
I have abandon&apos;d Troy, left my possession,
Incurr&apos;d a traitor&apos;s name; exposed myself,
From certain and possess&apos;d conveniences,
To doubtful fortunes; sequestering from me all
That time, acquaintance, custom and condition
Made tame and most familiar to my nature,
And here, to do you service, am become
As new into the world, strange, unacquainted:
I do beseech you, as in way of taste,
To give me now a little benefit,
Out of those many register&apos;d in promise,
Which, you say, live to come in my behalf.

You have a Trojan prisoner, call&apos;d Antenor,
Yesterday took: Troy holds him very dear.
Oft have you--often have you thanks therefore--
Desired my Cressid in right great exchange,
Whom Troy hath still denied: but this Antenor,
I know, is such a wrest in their affairs
That their negotiations all must slack,
Wanting his manage; and they will almost
Give us a prince of blood, a son of Priam,
In change of him: let him be sent, great princes,
And he shall buy my daughter; and her presence
Shall quite strike off all service I have done,
In most accepted pain.</string>

		<string>Achilles stands i&apos; the entrance of his tent:
Please it our general to pass strangely by him,
As if he were forgot; and, princes all,
Lay negligent and loose regard upon him:
I will come last. &apos;Tis like he&apos;ll question me
Why such unplausive eyes are bent on him:
If so, I have derision medicinable,
To use between your strangeness and his pride,
Which his own will shall have desire to drink:
It may be good: pride hath no other glass
To show itself but pride, for supple knees
Feed arrogance and are the proud man&apos;s fees.</string>

		<string>What, am I poor of late?
&apos;Tis certain, greatness, once fall&apos;n out with fortune,
Must fall out with men too: what the declined is
He shall as soon read in the eyes of others
As feel in his own fall; for men, like butterflies,
Show not their mealy wings but to the summer,
And not a man, for being simply man,
Hath any honour, but honour for those honours
That are without him, as place, riches, favour,
Prizes of accident as oft as merit:
Which when they fall, as being slippery standers,
The love that lean&apos;d on them as slippery too,
Do one pluck down another and together
Die in the fall. But &apos;tis not so with me:
Fortune and I are friends: I do enjoy
At ample point all that I did possess,
Save these men&apos;s looks; who do, methinks, find out
Something not worth in me such rich beholding
As they have often given. Here is Ulysses;
I&apos;ll interrupt his reading.
How now Ulysses!</string>

		<string>And why, I pray you? Who might be your mother,
That you insult, exult, and all at once,
Over the wretched? What though you have no beauty,--
As, by my faith, I see no more in you
Than without candle may go dark to bed--
Must you be therefore proud and pitiless?
Why, what means this? Why do you look on me?
I see no more in you than in the ordinary
Of nature&apos;s sale-work. &apos;Od&apos;s my little life,
I think she means to tangle my eyes too!
No, faith, proud mistress, hope not after it:
&apos;Tis not your inky brows, your black silk hair,
Your bugle eyeballs, nor your cheek of cream,
That can entame my spirits to your worship.
You foolish shepherd, wherefore do you follow her,
Like foggy south puffing with wind and rain?
You are a thousand times a properer man
Than she a woman: &apos;tis such fools as you
That makes the world full of ill-favour&apos;d children:
&apos;Tis not her glass, but you, that flatters her;
And out of you she sees herself more proper
Than any of her lineaments can show her.
But, mistress, know yourself: down on your knees,
And thank heaven, fasting, for a good man&apos;s love:
For I must tell you friendly in your ear,
Sell when you can: you are not for all markets:
Cry the man mercy; love him; take his offer:
Foul is most foul, being foul to be a scoffer.
So take her to thee, shepherd: fare you well.</string>

		<string>A strange fellow here
Writes me: &apos;That man, how dearly ever parted,
How much in having, or without or in,
Cannot make boast to have that which he hath,
Nor feels not what he owes, but by reflection;
As when his virtues shining upon others
Heat them and they retort that heat again
To the first giver.&apos;

I do not strain at the position,--
It is familiar,--but at the author&apos;s drift;
Who, in his circumstance, expressly proves
That no man is the lord of any thing,
Though in and of him there be much consisting,
Till he communicate his parts to others:
Nor doth he of himself know them for aught
Till he behold them form&apos;d in the applause
Where they&apos;re extended; who, like an arch,
reverberates
The voice again, or, like a gate of steel
Fronting the sun, receives and renders back
His figure and his heat. I was much wrapt in this;
And apprehended here immediately
The unknown Ajax.
Heavens, what a man is there! a very horse,
That has he knows not what. Nature, what things there are
Most abject in regard and dear in use!
What things again most dear in the esteem
And poor in worth! Now shall we see to-morrow--
An act that very chance doth throw upon him--
Ajax renown&apos;d. O heavens, what some men do,
While some men leave to do!
How some men creep in skittish fortune&apos;s hall,
Whiles others play the idiots in her eyes!
How one man eats into another&apos;s pride,
While pride is fasting in his wantonness!
To see these Grecian lords!--why, even already
They clap the lubber Ajax on the shoulder,
As if his foot were on brave Hector&apos;s breast
And great Troy shrieking.

Time hath, my lord, a wallet at his back,
Wherein he puts alms for oblivion,
A great-sized monster of ingratitudes:
Those scraps are good deeds past; which are devour&apos;d
As fast as they are made, forgot as soon
As done: perseverance, dear my lord,
Keeps honour bright: to have done is to hang
Quite out of fashion, like a rusty mail
In monumental mockery. Take the instant way;
For honour travels in a strait so narrow,
Where one but goes abreast: keep then the path;
For emulation hath a thousand sons
That one by one pursue: if you give way,
Or hedge aside from the direct forthright,
Like to an enter&apos;d tide, they all rush by
And leave you hindmost;
Or like a gallant horse fall&apos;n in first rank,
Lie there for pavement to the abject rear,
O&apos;er-run and trampled on: then what they do in present,
Though less than yours in past, must o&apos;ertop yours;
For time is like a fashionable host
That slightly shakes his parting guest by the hand,
And with his arms outstretch&apos;d, as he would fly,
Grasps in the comer: welcome ever smiles,
And farewell goes out sighing. O, let not
virtue seek
Remuneration for the thing it was;
For beauty, wit,
High birth, vigour of bone, desert in service,
Love, friendship, charity, are subjects all
To envious and calumniating time.
One touch of nature makes the whole world kin,
That all with one consent praise new-born gawds,
Though they are made and moulded of things past,
And give to dust that is a little gilt
More laud than gilt o&apos;er-dusted.
The present eye praises the present object.
Then marvel not, thou great and complete man,
That all the Greeks begin to worship Ajax;
Since things in motion sooner catch the eye
Than what not stirs. The cry went once on thee,
And still it might, and yet it may again,
If thou wouldst not entomb thyself alive
And case thy reputation in thy tent;
Whose glorious deeds, but in these fields of late,
Made emulous missions &apos;mongst the gods themselves
And drave great Mars to faction.</string>

		<string>Ajax goes up and down the field, asking for himself.

He must fight singly to-morrow with Hector, and is so
prophetically proud of an heroical cudgelling that he
raves in saying nothing.

Why, he stalks up and down like a peacock,--a stride
and a stand: ruminates like an hostess that hath no
arithmetic but her brain to set down her reckoning:
bites his lip with a politic regard, as who should
say &apos;There were wit in this head, an &apos;twould out;&apos;
and so there is, but it lies as coldly in him as fire
in a flint, which will not show without knocking.
The man&apos;s undone forever; for if Hector break not his
neck i&apos; the combat, he&apos;ll break &apos;t himself in
vain-glory. He knows not me: I said &apos;Good morrow,
Ajax;&apos; and he replies &apos;Thanks, Agamemnon.&apos; What think
you of this man that takes me for the general? He&apos;s
grown a very land-fish, language-less, a monster.
A plague of opinion! a man may wear it on both

And suddenly; where injury of chance
Puts back leave-taking, justles roughly by
All time of pause, rudely beguiles our lips
Of all rejoindure, forcibly prevents
Our lock&apos;d embrasures, strangles our dear vows
Even in the birth of our own labouring breath:
We two, that with so many thousand sighs
Did buy each other, must poorly sell ourselves
With the rude brevity and discharge of one.
Injurious time now with a robber&apos;s haste
Crams his rich thievery up, he knows not how:
As many farewells as be stars in heaven,
With distinct breath and consign&apos;d kisses to them,
He fumbles up into a lose adieu,
And scants us with a single famish&apos;d kiss,
Distasted with the salt of broken tears.</string>

Not yet mature, yet matchless, firm of word,
Speaking in deeds and deedless in his tongue;
Not soon provoked nor being provoked soon calm&apos;d:
His heart and hand both open and both free;
For what he has he gives, what thinks he shows;
Yet gives he not till judgment guide his bounty,
Nor dignifies an impure thought with breath;
Manly as Hector, but more dangerous;
For Hector in his blaze of wrath subscribes
To tender objects, but he in heat of action
Is more vindicative than jealous love:
They call him Troilus, and on him erect
A second hope, as fairly built as Hector.
Thus says AEneas; one that knows the youth
Even to his inches, and with private soul
Did in great Ilion thus translate him to me.</string>

		<string>Think not I love him, though I ask for him:
&apos;Tis but a peevish boy; yet he talks well;
But what care I for words? yet words do well
When he that speaks them pleases those that hear.
It is a pretty youth: not very pretty:
But, sure, he&apos;s proud, and yet his pride becomes him:
He&apos;ll make a proper man: the best thing in him
Is his complexion; and faster than his tongue
Did make offence his eye did heal it up.
He is not very tall; yet for his years he&apos;s tall:
His leg is but so so; and yet &apos;tis well:
There was a pretty redness in his lip,
A little riper and more lusty red
Than that mix&apos;d in his cheek; &apos;twas just the difference
Between the constant red and mingled damask.
There be some women, Silvius, had they mark&apos;d him
In parcels as I did, would have gone near
To fall in love with him; but, for my part,
I love him not nor hate him not; and yet
I have more cause to hate him than to love him:
For what had he to do to chide at me?
He said mine eyes were black and my hair black:
And, now I am remember&apos;d, scorn&apos;d at me:
I marvel why I answer&apos;d not again:
But that&apos;s all one; omittance is no quittance.
I&apos;ll write to him a very taunting letter,
And thou shalt bear it: wilt thou, Silvius?</string>

Sit, gods, upon your thrones, and smile at Troy!

And linger not our sure destructions on!

You understand me not that tell me so:
I do not speak of flight, of fear, of death,
But dare all imminence that gods and men
Address their dangers in. Hector is gone:
Who shall tell Priam so, or Hecuba?
Let him that will a screech-owl aye be call&apos;d,
Go in to Troy, and say there, Hector&apos;s dead:
There is a word will Priam turn to stone;
Make wells and Niobes of the maids and wives,
Cold statues of the youth, and, in a word,
Scare Troy out of itself. But, march away:
Hector is dead; there is no more to say.
Stay yet. You vile abominable tents,
Thus proudly pight upon our Phrygian plains,
Let Titan rise as early as he dare,
I&apos;ll through and through you! and, thou great-sized coward,
No space of earth shall sunder our two hates:
I&apos;ll haunt thee like a wicked conscience still,
That mouldeth goblins swift as frenzy&apos;s thoughts.
Strike a free march to Troy! with comfort go:
Hope of revenge shall hide our inward woe.</string>

You must know of me then, Antonio, my name is Sebastian, which I called Roderigo. My father was that Sebastian of Messaline, whom I know you have heard of.

cross-gartered: I say, remember. Go to, thou art
made, if thou desirest to be so; if not, let me see
thee a steward still, the fellow of servants, and
not worthy to touch Fortune&apos;s fingers. Farewell.
She that would alter services with thee,
THE FORTUNATE-UNHAPPY.&apos;

Daylight and champaign discovers not more: this is open. I will be proud, I will read politic authors,
I will baffle Sir Toby, I will wash off gross acquaintance, I will be point-devise the very man.
I do not now fool myself, to let imagination jade me; for every reason excites to this, that my lady
loves me. She did commend my yellow stockings of late, she did praise my leg being cross-gartered; and in this she manifests herself to my love, and with a kind of injunction drives me to these habits of her liking. I thank my stars I am happy. I will be strange, stout, in yellow stockings, and cross-gartered, even with the swiftness of putting on. Jove and my stars be praised! Here is yet a postscript.

&apos;Thou canst not choose but know who I am. If thou
entertainest my love, let it appear in thy smiling;
thy smiles become thee well; therefore in my
presence still smile, dear my sweet, I prithee.&apos;

Jove, I thank thee: I will smile; I will do everything that thou wilt have me.</string>

		<string>This fellow is wise enough to play the fool;
And to do that well craves a kind of wit:
He must observe their mood on whom he jests,
The quality of persons, and the time,
And, like the haggard, cheque at every feather
That comes before his eye. This is a practise
As full of labour as a wise man&apos;s art
For folly that he wisely shows is fit;
But wise men, folly-fall&apos;n, quite taint their wit.</string>

In the contempt and anger of his lip!
A murderous guilt shows not itself more soon
Than love that would seem hid: love&apos;s night is noon.
Cesario, by the roses of the spring,
By maidhood, honour, truth and every thing,
I love thee so, that, maugre all thy pride,
Nor wit nor reason can my passion hide.
Do not extort thy reasons from this clause,
For that I woo, thou therefore hast no cause,
But rather reason thus with reason fetter,
Love sought is good, but given unsought better.</string>

Believe then, if you please, that I can do strange things: I have, since I was three year old, conversed with a magician, most profound in his art and yet not damnable. If you do love Rosalind so near the heart as your gesture cries it out, when your brother marries Aliena, shall you marry her: I know into what straits of fortune she is driven; and it is not impossible to me, if it appear not inconvenient to you, to set her before your eyes tomorrow human as she is and without any danger.

[Speakest thou in sober meanings?]

By my life, I do; which I tender dearly, though I say I am a magician. Therefore, put you in your best array: bid your friends; for if you will be married to-morrow, you shall, and to Rosalind, if you will.</string>

For though my soul disputes well with my sense,

Yet doth this accident and flood of fortune
So far exceed all instance, all discourse,

And wrangle with my reason that persuades me
To any other trust but that I am mad
Or else the lady&apos;s mad; yet, if &apos;twere so,
She could not sway her house, command her followers,
Take and give back affairs and their dispatch
With such a smooth, discreet and stable bearing
As I perceive she does: there&apos;s something in&apos;t
That is deceiveable. But here the lady comes.</string>

Be pleased that I shake off these names you give me:
Antonio never yet was thief or pirate,
Though I confess, on base and ground enough,
Orsino&apos;s enemy. A witchcraft drew me hither:
That most ingrateful boy there by your side,
From the rude sea&apos;s enraged and foamy mouth
Did I redeem; a wreck past hope he was:
His life I gave him and did thereto add
My love, without retention or restraint,
All his in dedication; for his sake
Did I expose myself, pure for his love,
Into the danger of this adverse town;
Drew to defend him when he was beset:
Where being apprehended, his false cunning,
Not meaning to partake with me in danger,
Taught him to face me out of his acquaintance,
And grew a twenty years removed thing
While one would wink; denied me mine own purse,
Which I had recommended to his use
Not half an hour before.</string>

Upon Sir Toby and the lighter people;
And, acting this in an obedient hope,
Why have you suffer&apos;d me to be imprison&apos;d,
Kept in a dark house, visited by the priest,
And made the most notorious geck and gull
That e&apos;er invention play&apos;d on? tell me why.</string>

Which I have wonder&apos;d at. In hope it shall not,
Most freely I confess, myself and Toby
Set this device against Malvolio here,
Upon some stubborn and uncourteous parts
We had conceived against him: Maria writ
The letter at Sir Toby&apos;s great importance;
In recompense whereof he hath married her.
How with a sportful malice it was follow&apos;d,
May rather pluck on laughter than revenge;
If that the injuries be justly weigh&apos;d
That have on both sides pass&apos;d.</string>

		<string>Cease to persuade, my loving Proteus:
Home-keeping youth have ever homely wits.
Were&apos;t not affection chains thy tender days
To the sweet glances of thy honour&apos;d love,
I rather would entreat thy company
To see the wonders of the world abroad,
Than, living dully sluggardized at home,
Wear out thy youth with shapeless idleness.
But since thou lovest, love still and thrive therein,
Even as I would when I to love begin.</string>

		<string>Love is your master, for he masters you:
And he that is so yoked by a fool,
Methinks, should not be chronicled for wise.

And writers say, as the most forward bud
Is eaten by the canker ere it blow,
Even so by love the young and tender wit
Is turn&apos;d to folly, blasting in the bud,
Losing his verdure even in the prime
And all the fair effects of future hopes.
But wherefore waste I time to counsel thee,
That art a votary to fond desire?
Once more adieu! my father at the road
Expects my coming, there to see me shipp&apos;d.</string>

		<string>I did dislike the cut of a certain courtier&apos;s beard: he sent me word, if I said his beard was not cut well, he was in the mind it was: this is called the Retort Courteous. If I sent him word again &apos;it was not well cut,&apos; he would send me word, he cut it to please himself: this is called the Quip Modest. If again &apos;it was not well cut,&apos; he disabled my judgment: this is called the Reply Churlish. If again &apos;it was not well cut,&apos; he would answer, I spake not true: this is called the Reproof Valiant. If again &apos;it was not well cut,&apos; he would say I lied: this is called the Counter-cheque Quarrelsome: and so to the Lie Circumstantial and the Lie Direct.

[And how oft did you say his beard was not well cut?]

I durst go no further than the Lie Circumstantial, nor he durst not give me the Lie Direct; and so we measured swords and parted.

[Can you nominate in order now the degrees of the lie?]

O sir, we quarrel in print, by the book; as you have books for good manners: I will name you the degrees. The first, the Retort Courteous; the second, the Quip Modest; the third, the Reply Churlish; the fourth, the Reproof Valiant; the fifth, the Countercheque Quarrelsome; the sixth, the Lie with Circumstance; the seventh, the Lie Direct. All these you may avoid but the Lie Direct; and you may avoid that too, with an If. I knew when seven justices could not take up a quarrel, but when the parties were met themselves, one of them thought but of an If, as, &apos;If you said so, then I said so;&apos; and they shook hands and swore brothers. Your If is the only peacemaker; much virtue in If.</string>

And would not force the letter to my view!
Since maids, in modesty, say &apos;no&apos; to that
Which they would have the profferer construe &apos;ay.&apos;
Fie, fie, how wayward is this foolish love
That, like a testy babe, will scratch the nurse
And presently all humbled kiss the rod!
How churlishly I chid Lucetta hence,
When willingly I would have had her here!
How angerly I taught my brow to frown,
When inward joy enforced my heart to smile!
My penance is to call Lucetta back
And ask remission for my folly past.
What ho! Lucetta!</string>

O hateful hands, to tear such loving words!
Injurious wasps, to feed on such sweet honey
And kill the bees that yield it with your stings!
I&apos;ll kiss each several paper for amends.
Look, here is writ &apos;kind Julia.&apos; Unkind Julia!
As in revenge of thy ingratitude,
I throw thy name against the bruising stones,
Trampling contemptuously on thy disdain.
And here is writ &apos;love-wounded Proteus.&apos;
Poor wounded name! my bosom as a bed
Shall lodge thee till thy wound be thoroughly heal&apos;d;
And thus I search it with a sovereign kiss.
But twice or thrice was &apos;Proteus&apos; written down.
Be calm, good wind, blow not a word away
Till I have found each letter in the letter,
Except mine own name: that some whirlwind bear
Unto a ragged fearful-hanging rock
And throw it thence into the raging sea!
Lo, here in one line is his name twice writ,
&apos;Poor forlorn Proteus, passionate Proteus,
To the sweet Julia:&apos; that I&apos;ll tear away.
And yet I will not, sith so prettily
He couples it to his complaining names.
Thus will I fold them one on another:
Now kiss, embrace, contend, do what you will.</string>

While other men, of slender reputation,
Put forth their sons to seek preferment out:
Some to the wars, to try their fortune there;
Some to discover islands far away;
Some to the studious universities.
For any or for all these exercises,
He said that Proteus your son was meet,
And did request me to importune you
To let him spend his time no more at home,
Which would be great impeachment to his age,
In having known no travel in his youth.</string>

Now come I to my father; Father, your blessing: now should not the shoe speak a word for weeping: now should I kiss my father; well, he weeps on. Now come I to my mother: O, that she could speak now like a wood woman! Well, I kiss her; why, there &apos;tis; here&apos;s my mother&apos;s breath up and down.

His years but young, but his experience old;
His head unmellow&apos;d, but his judgment ripe;
And, in a word, for far behind his worth
Comes all the praises that I now bestow,
He is complete in feature and in mind
With all good grace to grace a gentleman.</string>

I have done penance for contemning Love,
Whose high imperious thoughts have punish&apos;d me
With bitter fasts, with penitential groans,
With nightly tears and daily heart-sore sighs;
For in revenge of my contempt of love,
Love hath chased sleep from my enthralled eyes
And made them watchers of mine own heart&apos;s sorrow.
O gentle Proteus, Love&apos;s a mighty lord,
And hath so humbled me, as, I confess,
There is no woe to his correction,
Nor to his service no such joy on earth.
Now no discourse, except it be of love;
Now can I break my fast, dine, sup and sleep,
Upon the very naked name of love.</string>

She is fair; and so is Julia that I love--
That I did love, for now my love is thaw&apos;d;
Which, like a waxen image, &apos;gainst a fire,
Bears no impression of the thing it was.
Methinks my zeal to Valentine is cold,
And that I love him not as I was wont.
O, but I love his lady too too much,
And that&apos;s the reason I love him so little.
How shall I dote on her with more advice,
That thus without advice begin to love her!
&apos;Tis but her picture I have yet beheld,
And that hath dazzled my reason&apos;s light;
But when I look on her perfections,
There is no reason but I shall be blind.
If I can cheque my erring love, I will;
If not, to compass her I&apos;ll use my skill.</string>

And even that power which gave me first my oath
Provokes me to this threefold perjury;
Love bade me swear and Love bids me forswear.
O sweet-suggesting Love, if thou hast sinned,
Teach me, thy tempted subject, to excuse it!
At first I did adore a twinkling star,
But now I worship a celestial sun.
Unheedful vows may heedfully be broken,
And he wants wit that wants resolved will
To learn his wit to exchange the bad for better.
Fie, fie, unreverend tongue! to call her bad,
Whose sovereignty so oft thou hast preferr&apos;d
With twenty thousand soul-confirming oaths.
I cannot leave to love, and yet I do;
But there I leave to love where I should love.
Julia I lose and Valentine I lose:
If I keep them, I needs must lose myself;
If I lose them, thus find I by their loss
For Valentine myself, for Julia Silvia.
I to myself am dearer than a friend,
For love is still most precious in itself;
And Silvia--witness Heaven, that made her fair!--
Shows Julia but a swarthy Ethiope.
I will forget that Julia is alive,
Remembering that my love to her is dead;
And Valentine I&apos;ll hold an enemy,
Aiming at Silvia as a sweeter friend.
I cannot now prove constant to myself,
Without some treachery used to Valentine.
This night he meaneth with a corded ladder
To climb celestial Silvia&apos;s chamber-window,
Myself in counsel, his competitor.
Now presently I&apos;ll give her father notice
Of their disguising and pretended flight;
Who, all enraged, will banish Valentine;
For Thurio, he intends, shall wed his daughter;
But, Valentine being gone, I&apos;ll quickly cross
By some sly trick blunt Thurio&apos;s dull proceeding.
Love, lend me wings to make my purpose swift,
As thou hast lent me wit to plot this drift!</string>

The law of friendship bids me to conceal;
But when I call to mind your gracious favours
Done to me, undeserving as I am,
My duty pricks me on to utter that
Which else no worldly good should draw from me.
Know, worthy prince, Sir Valentine, my friend,
This night intends to steal away your daughter:
Myself am one made privy to the plot.
I know you have determined to bestow her
On Thurio, whom your gentle daughter hates;
And should she thus be stol&apos;n away from you,
It would be much vexation to your age.
Thus, for my duty&apos;s sake, I rather chose
To cross my friend in his intended drift
Than, by concealing it, heap on your head
A pack of sorrows which would press you down,
Being unprevented, to your timeless grave.</string>

This love of theirs myself have often seen,
Haply when they have judged me fast asleep,
And oftentimes have purposed to forbid
Sir Valentine her company and my court:
But fearing lest my jealous aim might err
And so unworthily disgrace the man,
A rashness that I ever yet have shunn&apos;d,
I gave him gentle looks, thereby to find
That which thyself hast now disclosed to me.
And, that thou mayst perceive my fear of this,
Knowing that tender youth is soon suggested,
I nightly lodge her in an upper tower,
The key whereof myself have ever kept;
And thence she cannot be convey&apos;d away.</string>

Send her another; never give her o&apos;er;
For scorn at first makes after-love the more.
If she do frown, &apos;tis not in hate of you,
But rather to beget more love in you:
If she do chide, &apos;tis not to have you gone;
For why, the fools are mad, if left alone.
Take no repulse, whatever she doth say;
For &apos;get you gone,&apos; she doth not mean &apos;away!&apos;

[Reads]

&apos;My thoughts do harbour with my Silvia nightly,
And slaves they are to me that send them flying:
O, could their master come and go as lightly,
Himself would lodge where senseless they are lying!
My herald thoughts in thy pure bosom rest them:
While I, their king, that hither them importune,
Do curse the grace that with such grace hath bless&apos;d them,
Because myself do want my servants&apos; fortune:
I curse myself, for they are sent by me,
That they should harbour where their lord would be.&apos;
What&apos;s here?
&apos;Silvia, this night I will enfranchise thee.&apos;
&apos;Tis so; and here&apos;s the ladder for the purpose.
Why, Phaeton,--for thou art Merops&apos; son,--
Wilt thou aspire to guide the heavenly car
And with thy daring folly burn the world?
Wilt thou reach stars, because they shine on thee?
Go, base intruder! overweening slave!
Bestow thy fawning smiles on equal mates,
And think my patience, more than thy desert,
Is privilege for thy departure hence:
Thank me for this more than for all the favours
Which all too much I have bestow&apos;d on thee.
But if thou linger in my territories
Longer than swiftest expedition
Will give thee time to leave our royal court,
By heaven! my wrath shall far exceed the love
I ever bore my daughter or thyself.
Be gone! I will not hear thy vain excuse;
But, as thou lovest thy life, make speed from hence.</string>

To die is to be banish&apos;d from myself;
And Silvia is myself: banish&apos;d from her
Is self from self: a deadly banishment!
What light is light, if Silvia be not seen?
What joy is joy, if Silvia be not by?
Unless it be to think that she is by
And feed upon the shadow of perfection
Except I be by Silvia in the night,
There is no music in the nightingale;
Unless I look on Silvia in the day,
There is no day for me to look upon;
She is my essence, and I leave to be,
If I be not by her fair influence
Foster&apos;d, illumined, cherish&apos;d, kept alive.
I fly not death, to fly his deadly doom:
Tarry I here, I but attend on death:
But, fly I hence, I fly away from life.</string>

Tune a deploring dump: the night&apos;s dead silence

When to her beauty I commend my vows,
She bids me think how I have been forsworn
In breaking faith with Julia whom I loved:
And notwithstanding all her sudden quips,
The least whereof would quell a lover&apos;s hope,
Yet, spaniel-like, the more she spurns my love,
The more it grows and fawneth on her still.
But here comes Thurio: now must we to her window,
And give some evening music to her ear.</string>

I know I love in vain, strive against hope;
Yet in this captious and intenible sieve
I still pour in the waters of my love
And lack not to lose still: thus, Indian-like,
Religious in mine error, I adore
The sun, that looks upon his worshipper,
But knows of him no more. My dearest madam,
Let not your hate encounter with my love
For loving where you do: but if yourself,
Whose aged honour cites a virtuous youth,
Did ever in so true a flame of liking
Wish chastely and love dearly, that your Dian
Was both herself and love: O, then, give pity
To her, whose state is such that cannot choose
But lend and give where she is sure to lose;
That seeks not to find that her search implies,
But riddle-like lives sweetly where she dies!</string>

And, for the ways are dangerous to pass,
I do desire thy worthy company,
Upon whose faith and honour I repose.
Urge not my father&apos;s anger, Eglamour,
But think upon my grief, a lady&apos;s grief,
And on the justice of my flying hence,
To keep me from a most unholy match,
Which heaven and fortune still rewards with plagues.
I do desire thee, even from a heart

I have taught him, even as one would say precisely, &apos;thus I would teach a dog.&apos; I was sent to deliver him as a present to Mistress Silvia from my master; and I came no sooner into the dining-chamber but he steps me to her trencher and steals her capon&apos;s leg: O, &apos;tis a foul thing when a cur cannot keep himself in all companies! I would have, as one should say, one that takes upon him to be a dog indeed, to be, as it were, a dog at all things. If I had not had more wit than he, to take a fault upon me that he did, I think verily he had been hanged for&apos;t; sure as I live, he had suffered for&apos;t; you shall judge. He thrusts me himself into the company of three or four gentlemanlike dogs under the duke&apos;s table: he had not been there--bless the mark!--a pissing while, but all the chamber smelt him. &apos;Out with the dog!&apos; says one: &apos;What cur is that?&apos; says another: &apos;Whip him out&apos; says the third: &apos;Hang him up&apos; says the duke. I, having been acquainted with the smell before, knew it was Crab, and goes me to the fellow that whips the dogs: &apos;Friend,&apos; quoth I, &apos;you mean to whip the dog?&apos; &apos;Ay, marry, do I,&apos; quoth he. &apos;You do him the more wrong,&apos; quoth I; &apos;&apos;twas I did the thing you wot of.&apos; He makes me no more ado, but whips me out of the chamber. How many masters would do this for his servant? Nay, I&apos;ll be sworn, I have sat in the stocks for puddings he hath stolen, otherwise he had been executed; I have stood on the pillory for geese he hath killed, otherwise he had suffered for&apos;t. Thou thinkest not of this now. Nay, I remember the trick you served me when I took my leave of Madam Silvia: did not I bid thee still mark me and do as I do? when didst thou see me heave up my leg and make water against a gentlewoman&apos;s farthingale? didst thou ever see me do such a trick?</string>

Alas, poor Proteus! thou hast entertain&apos;d

Alas, poor fool! why do I pity him
That with his very heart despiseth me?
Because he loves her, he despiseth me;
Because I love him I must pity him.
This ring I gave him when he parted from me,
To bind him to remember my good will;
And now am I, unhappy messenger,
To plead for that which I would not obtain,
To carry that which I would have refused,
To praise his faith which I would have dispraised.
I am my master&apos;s true-confirmed love;
But cannot be true servant to my master,
Unless I prove false traitor to myself.
Yet will I woo for him, but yet so coldly
As, heaven it knows, I would not have him speed.</string>

		<string>She hath been fairer, madam, than she is:
When she did think my master loved her well,
She, in my judgment, was as fair as you:
But since she did neglect her looking-glass
And threw her sun-expelling mask away,
The air hath starved the roses in her cheeks
And pinch&apos;d the lily-tincture of her face,
That now she is become as black as I.

About my stature; for at Pentecost,
When all our pageants of delight were play&apos;d,
Our youth got me to play the woman&apos;s part,
And I was trimm&apos;d in Madam Julia&apos;s gown,
Which served me as fit, by all men&apos;s judgments,
As if the garment had been made for me:
Therefore I know she is about my height.
And at that time I made her weep agood,
For I did play a lamentable part:
Madam, &apos;twas Ariadne passioning
For Theseus&apos; perjury and unjust flight;
Which I so lively acted with my tears
That my poor mistress, moved therewithal,
Wept bitterly; and would I might be dead
If I in thought felt not her very sorrow!</string>

		<string>Sicilia cannot show himself over-kind to Bohemia.
They were trained together in their childhoods; and
there rooted betwixt them then such an affection,
which cannot choose but branch now. Since their
more mature dignities and royal necessities made
separation of their society, their encounters,
though not personal, have been royally attorneyed
with interchange of gifts, letters, loving
embassies; that they have seemed to be together,
though absent, shook hands, as over a vast, and
embraced, as it were, from the ends of opposed
winds. The heavens continue their loves!</string>

And many a man there is, even at this present,
Now while I speak this, holds his wife by the arm,
That little thinks she has been sluiced in&apos;s absence
And his pond fish&apos;d by his next neighbour, by

Whiles other men have gates and those gates open&apos;d,

Would hang themselves. Physic for&apos;t there is none;
It is a bawdy planet, that will strike
Where &apos;tis predominant; and &apos;tis powerful, think it,
From east, west, north and south: be it concluded,
No barricado for a belly; know&apos;t; 
It will let in and out the enemy

Have the disease, and feel&apos;t not. How now, boy!</string>

Against the non-performance, &apos;twas a fear
Which oft infects the wisest: these, my lord,
Are such allow&apos;d infirmities that honesty
Is never free of. But, beseech your grace,
Be plainer with me; let me know my trespass
By its own visage: if I then deny it,

		<string>There&apos;s some ill planet reigns:
I must be patient till the heavens look
With an aspect more favourable. Good my lords,
I am not prone to weeping, as our sex
Commonly are; the want of which vain dew
Perchance shall dry your pities: but I have
That honourable grief lodged here which burns
Worse than tears drown: beseech you all, my lords,
With thoughts so qualified as your charities
Shall best instruct you, measure me; and so
The king&apos;s will be perform&apos;d!

Who is&apos;t that goes with me? Beseech your highness,
My women may be with me; for you see
My plight requires it. Do not weep, good fools;
There is no cause: when you shall know your mistress
Has deserved prison, then abound in tears
As I come out: this action I now go on
Is for my better grace. Adieu, my lord:
I never wish&apos;d to see you sorry; now
I trust I shall. My women, come; you have leave.</string>

And never to my red-look&apos;d anger be
The trumpet any more. Pray you, Emilia,
Commend my best obedience to the queen:
If she dares trust me with her little babe,
I&apos;ll show&apos;t the king and undertake to be
Her advocate to the loud&apos;st. We do not know
How he may soften at the sight o&apos; the child:
The silence often of pure innocence
Persuades when speaking fails.</string>

And, might we lay the old proverb to your charge,
So like you, &apos;tis the worse. Behold, my lords,
Although the print be little, the whole matter
And copy of the father, eye, nose, lip,
The trick of&apos;s frown, his forehead, nay, the valley,
The pretty dimples of his chin and cheek,
His smiles,
The very mould and frame of hand, nail, finger:
And thou, good goddess Nature, which hast made it
So like to him that got it, if thou hast
The ordering of the mind too, &apos;mongst all colours
No yellow in&apos;t, lest she suspect, as he does,
Her children not her husband&apos;s!</string>

		<string>A heavier task could not have been imposed
Than I to speak my griefs unspeakable:
Yet, that the world may witness that my end
Was wrought by nature, not by vile offence,
I&apos;ll utter what my sorrows give me leave.
In Syracusa was I born, and wed
Unto a woman, happy but for me,
And by me, had not our hap been bad.
With her I lived in joy; our wealth increased
By prosperous voyages I often made
To Epidamnum; till my factor&apos;s death
And the great care of goods at random left
Drew me from kind embracements of my spouse:
From whom my absence was not six months old
Before herself, almost at fainting under
The pleasing punishment that women bear,
Had made provision for her following me
And soon and safe arrived where I was.
There had she not been long, but she became
A joyful mother of two goodly sons;
And, which was strange, the one so like the other,
As could not be distinguish&apos;d but by names.
That very hour, and in the self-same inn,
A meaner woman was delivered
Of such a burden, male twins, both alike:
Those,--for their parents were exceeding poor,--
I bought and brought up to attend my sons.
My wife, not meanly proud of two such boys,
Made daily motions for our home return:
Unwilling I agreed. Alas! too soon,
We came aboard.
A league from Epidamnum had we sail&apos;d,
Before the always wind-obeying deep
Gave any tragic instance of our harm:
But longer did we not retain much hope;
For what obscured light the heavens did grant
Did but convey unto our fearful minds
A doubtful warrant of immediate death;
Which though myself would gladly have embraced,
Yet the incessant weepings of my wife,
Weeping before for what she saw must come,
And piteous plainings of the pretty babes,
That mourn&apos;d for fashion, ignorant what to fear,
Forced me to seek delays for them and me.
And this it was, for other means was none:
The sailors sought for safety by our boat,
And left the ship, then sinking-ripe, to us:
My wife, more careful for the latter-born,
Had fasten&apos;d him unto a small spare mast,
Such as seafaring men provide for storms;
To him one of the other twins was bound,
Whilst I had been like heedful of the other:
The children thus disposed, my wife and I,
Fixing our eyes on whom our care was fix&apos;d,
Fasten&apos;d ourselves at either end the mast;
And floating straight, obedient to the stream,
Was carried towards Corinth, as we thought.
At length the sun, gazing upon the earth,
Dispersed those vapours that offended us;
And by the benefit of his wished light,
The seas wax&apos;d calm, and we discovered
Two ships from far making amain to us,
Of Corinth that, of Epidaurus this:
But ere they came,--O, let me say no more!
Gather the sequel by that went before.

O, had the gods done so, I had not now
Worthily term&apos;d them merciless to us!
For, ere the ships could meet by twice five leagues,
We were encounterd by a mighty rock;
Which being violently borne upon,
Our helpful ship was splitted in the midst;
So that, in this unjust divorce of us,
Fortune had left to both of us alike
What to delight in, what to sorrow for.
Her part, poor soul! seeming as burdened
With lesser weight but not with lesser woe,
Was carried with more speed before the wind;
And in our sight they three were taken up
By fishermen of Corinth, as we thought.
At length, another ship had seized on us;
And, knowing whom it was their hap to save,
Gave healthful welcome to their shipwreck&apos;d guests;
And would have reft the fishers of their prey,
Had not their bark been very slow of sail;
And therefore homeward did they bend their course.
Thus have you heard me sever&apos;d from my bliss;
That by misfortunes was my life prolong&apos;d,
To tell sad stories of my own mishaps.</string>

Which contradicts my accusation and
The testimony on my part no other

Being counted falsehood, shall, as I express it,
Be so received. But thus: if powers divine
Behold our human actions, as they do,
I doubt not then but innocence shall make
False accusation blush and tyranny
Tremble at patience. You, my lord, best know,
Who least will seem to do so, my past life
Hath been as continent, as chaste, as true,
As I am now unhappy; which is more
Than history can pattern, though devised
And play&apos;d to take spectators. For behold me
A fellow of the royal bed, which owe
A moiety of the throne a great king&apos;s daughter,
The mother to a hopeful prince, here standing
To prate and talk for life and honour &apos;fore
Who please to come and hear. For life, I prize it
As I weigh grief, which I would spare: for honour,
&apos;Tis a derivative from me to mine,
And only that I stand for. I appeal
To your own conscience, sir, before Polixenes
Came to your court, how I was in your grace,
How merited to be so; since he came,
With what encounter so uncurrent I
Have strain&apos;d to appear thus: if one jot beyond
The bound of honour, or in act or will
That way inclining, harden&apos;d be the hearts
Of all that hear me, and my near&apos;st of kin
Cry fie upon my grave!</string>

		<string>Sir, spare your threats:
The bug which you would fright me with I seek.
To me can life be no commodity:
The crown and comfort of my life, your favour,
I do give lost; for I do feel it gone,
But know not how it went. My second joy
And first-fruits of my body, from his presence
I am barr&apos;d, like one infectious. My third comfort
Starr&apos;d most unluckily, is from my breast,
The innocent milk in its most innocent mouth,
Haled out to murder: myself on every post
Proclaimed a strumpet: with immodest hatred
The child-bed privilege denied, which &apos;longs
To women of all fashion; lastly, hurried
Here to this place, i&apos; the open air, before
I have got strength of limit. Now, my liege,
Tell me what blessings I have here alive,
That I should fear to die? Therefore proceed.
But yet hear this: mistake me not; no life,
I prize it not a straw, but for mine honour,
Which I would free, if I shall be condemn&apos;d
Upon surmises, all proofs sleeping else
But what your jealousies awake, I tell you
&apos;Tis rigor and not law. Your honours all,
I do refer me to the oracle:
Apollo be my judge!</string>

O, cut my lace, lest my heart, cracking it,
Break too.

What studied torments, tyrant, hast for me?
What wheels? racks? fires? what flaying? boiling?
In leads or oils? what old or newer torture
Must I receive, whose every word deserves
To taste of thy most worst? Thy tyranny
Together working with thy jealousies,
Fancies too weak for boys, too green and idle
For girls of nine, O, think what they have done
And then run mad indeed, stark mad! for all
Thy by-gone fooleries were but spices of it.
That thou betray&apos;dst Polixenes,&apos;twas nothing;
That did but show thee, of a fool, inconstant
And damnable ingrateful: nor was&apos;t much,
Thou wouldst have poison&apos;d good Camillo&apos;s honour,
To have him kill a king: poor trespasses,
More monstrous standing by: whereof I reckon
The casting forth to crows thy baby-daughter
To be or none or little; though a devil
Would have shed water out of fire ere done&apos;t:
Nor is&apos;t directly laid to thee, the death
Of the young prince, whose honourable thoughts,
Thoughts high for one so tender, cleft the heart
That could conceive a gross and foolish sire
Blemish&apos;d his gracious dam: this is not, no,
Laid to thy answer: but the last,--O lords,
When I have said, cry &apos;woe!&apos; the queen, the queen,
The sweet&apos;st, dear&apos;st creature&apos;s dead,
and vengeance for&apos;t
Not dropp&apos;d down yet.

I say she&apos;s dead; I&apos;ll swear&apos;t. If word nor oath
Prevail not, go and see: if you can bring
Tincture or lustre in her lip, her eye,
Heat outwardly or breath within, I&apos;ll serve you
As I would do the gods. But, O thou tyrant!
Do not repent these things, for they are heavier
Than all thy woes can stir; therefore betake thee
To nothing but despair. A thousand knees
Ten thousand years together, naked, fasting,
Upon a barren mountain and still winter
In storm perpetual, could not move the gods
To look that way thou wert.

I am sorry for&apos;t:
All faults I make, when I shall come to know them,
I do repent. Alas! I have show&apos;d too much
The rashness of a woman: he is touch&apos;d
To the noble heart. What&apos;s gone and what&apos;s past help
Should be past grief: do not receive affliction
At my petition; I beseech you, rather
Let me be punish&apos;d, that have minded you
Of what you should forget. Now, good my liege
Sir, royal sir, forgive a foolish woman:
The love I bore your queen--lo, fool again!--
I&apos;ll speak of her no more, nor of your children;
I&apos;ll not remember you of my own lord,
Who is lost too: take your patience to you,
And I&apos;ll say nothing.</string>

I have heard, but not believed,
the spirits o&apos; the dead
May walk again: if such thing be, thy mother
Appear&apos;d to me last night, for ne&apos;er was dream
So like a waking. To me comes a creature,
Sometimes her head on one side, some another;
I never saw a vessel of like sorrow,
So fill&apos;d and so becoming: in pure white robes,
Like very sanctity, she did approach
My cabin where I lay; thrice bow&apos;d before me,
And gasping to begin some speech, her eyes
Became two spouts: the fury spent, anon
Did this break-from her: &apos;Good Antigonus,
Since fate, against thy better disposition,
Hath made thy person for the thrower-out
Of my poor babe, according to thine oath,
Places remote enough are in Bohemia,
There weep and leave it crying; and, for the babe
Is counted lost for ever, Perdita,
I prithee, call&apos;t. For this ungentle business
Put on thee by my lord, thou ne&apos;er shalt see
Thy wife Paulina more.&apos; And so, with shrieks
She melted into air. Affrighted much,
I did in time collect myself and thought
This was so and no slumber. Dreams are toys:
Yet for this once, yea, superstitiously,
I will be squared by this. I do believe
Hermione hath suffer&apos;d death, and that
Apollo would, this being indeed the issue
Of King Polixenes, it should here be laid,
Either for life or death, upon the earth
Of its right father. Blossom, speed thee well!
There lie, and there thy character: there these;
Which may, if fortune please, both breed thee, pretty,
And still rest thine. The storm begins; poor wretch,
That for thy mother&apos;s fault art thus exposed
To loss and what may follow! Weep I cannot,
But my heart bleeds; and most accursed am I
To be by oath enjoin&apos;d to this. Farewell!
The day frowns more and more: thou&apos;rt like to have
A lullaby too rough: I never saw
The heavens so dim by day. A savage clamour!
Well may I get aboard! This is the chase:
I am gone for ever.</string>

		<string>I would you did but see how it chafes, how it rages,
how it takes up the shore! but that&apos;s not the
point. O, the most piteous cry of the poor souls!
sometimes to see &apos;em, and not to see &apos;em; now the
ship boring the moon with her main-mast, and anon
swallowed with yest and froth, as you&apos;ld thrust a
cork into a hogshead. And then for the
land-service, to see how the bear tore out his
shoulder-bone; how he cried to me for help and said
his name was Antigonus, a nobleman. But to make an
end of the ship, to see how the sea flap-dragoned
it: but, first, how the poor souls roared, and the
sea mocked them; and how the poor gentleman roared
and the bear mocked him, both roaring louder than
the sea or weather.</string>

		<string>I, that please some, try all, both joy and terror
Of good and bad, that makes and unfolds error,
Now take upon me, in the name of Time,
To use my wings. Impute it not a crime
To me or my swift passage, that I slide
O&apos;er sixteen years and leave the growth untried
Of that wide gap, since it is in my power
To o&apos;erthrow law and in one self-born hour
To plant and o&apos;erwhelm custom. Let me pass
The same I am, ere ancient&apos;st order was
Or what is now received: I witness to
The times that brought them in; so shall I do
To the freshest things now reigning and make stale
The glistering of this present, as my tale
Now seems to it. Your patience this allowing,
I turn my glass and give my scene such growing
As you had slept between: Leontes leaving,
The effects of his fond jealousies so grieving
That he shuts up himself, imagine me,
Gentle spectators, that I now may be
In fair Bohemia, and remember well,
I mentioned a son o&apos; the king&apos;s, which Florizel
I now name to you; and with speed so pace
To speak of Perdita, now grown in grace
Equal with wondering: what of her ensues
I list not prophecy; but let Time&apos;s news
Be known when &apos;tis brought forth.
A shepherd&apos;s daughter,
And what to her adheres, which follows after,
Is the argument of Time. Of this allow,
If ever you have spent time worse ere now;
If never, yet that Time himself doth say
He wishes earnestly you never may.</string>

Thou shouldst a husband take by my consent,
As I by thine a wife: this is a match,
And made between&apos;s by vows. Thou hast found mine;
But how, is to be question&apos;d; for I saw her,
As I thought, dead, and have in vain said many
A prayer upon her grave. I&apos;ll not seek far--
For him, I partly know his mind--to find thee
An honourable husband. Come, Camillo,
And take her by the hand, whose worth and honesty
Is richly noted and here justified
By us, a pair of kings. Let&apos;s from this place.
What! look upon my brother: both your pardons,
That e&apos;er I put between your holy looks
My ill suspicion. This is your son-in-law,
And son unto the king, who, heavens directing,
Is troth-plight to your daughter. Good Paulina,
Lead us from hence, where we may leisurely
Each one demand an answer to his part
Perform&apos;d in this wide gap of time since first
We were dissever&apos;d: hastily lead away.</string>

Find we a time for frighted peace to pant,
And breathe short-winded accents of new broils
To be commenced in strands afar remote.
No more the thirsty entrance of this soil
Shall daub her lips with her own children&apos;s blood;
Nor more shall trenching war channel her fields,
Nor bruise her flowerets with the armed hoofs
Of hostile paces: those opposed eyes,
Which, like the meteors of a troubled heaven,
All of one nature, of one substance bred,
Did lately meet in the intestine shock
And furious close of civil butchery
Shall now, in mutual well-beseeming ranks,
March all one way and be no more opposed
Against acquaintance, kindred and allies:
The edge of war, like an ill-sheathed knife,
No more shall cut his master. Therefore, friends,
As far as to the sepulchre of Christ,
Whose soldier now, under whose blessed cross
We are impressed and engaged to fight,
Forthwith a power of English shall we levy;
Whose arms were moulded in their mothers&apos; womb
To chase these pagans in those holy fields
Over whose acres walk&apos;d those blessed feet
Which fourteen hundred years ago were nail&apos;d
For our advantage on the bitter cross.
But this our purpose now is twelve month old,
And bootless &apos;tis to tell you we will go:
Therefore we meet not now. Then let me hear
Of you, my gentle cousin Westmoreland,
What yesternight our council did decree
In forwarding this dear expedience.</string>

In cradle-clothes our children where they lay,
And call&apos;d mine Percy, his Plantagenet!
Then would I have his Harry, and he mine.
But let him from my thoughts. What think you, coz,
Of this young Percy&apos;s pride? the prisoners,
Which he in this adventure hath surprised,
To his own use he keeps; and sends me word, 
I shall have none but Mordake Earl of Fife. </string>

The unyoked humour of your idleness:
Yet herein will I imitate the sun, 
Who doth permit the base contagious clouds
To smother up his beauty from the world,
That, when he please again to be himself,
Being wanted, he may be more wonder&apos;d at,
By breaking through the foul and ugly mists
Of vapours that did seem to strangle him.
If all the year were playing holidays,
To sport would be as tedious as to work;
But when they seldom come, they wish&apos;d for come,
And nothing pleaseth but rare accidents. 
So, when this loose behavior I throw off
And pay the debt I never promised,
By how much better than my word I am,
By so much shall I falsify men&apos;s hopes;
And like bright metal on a sullen ground, 
My reformation, glittering o&apos;er my fault,
Shall show more goodly and attract more eyes
Than that which hath no foil to set it off.

But by the chance of war; to prove that true 
Needs no more but one tongue for all those wounds,
Those mouthed wounds, which valiantly he took
When on the gentle Severn&apos;s sedgy bank,
In single opposition, hand to hand,
He did confound the best part of an hour
In changing hardiment with great Glendower:
Three times they breathed and three times did they drink,
Upon agreement, of swift Severn&apos;s flood;
Who then, affrighted with their bloody looks,
Ran fearfully among the trembling reeds,
And hid his crisp head in the hollow bank,
Bloodstained with these valiant combatants.
Never did base and rotten policy
Colour her working with such deadly wounds;
Nor could the noble Mortimer
Receive so many, and all willingly:
Then let not him be slander&apos;d with revolt.</string>

An plant this thorn, this canker, Bolingbroke?

For what offence have I this fortnight been
A banish&apos;d woman from my Harry&apos;s bed?
Tell me, sweet lord, what is&apos;t that takes from thee
Thy stomach, pleasure and thy golden sleep? 
Why dost thou bend thine eyes upon the earth,
And start so often when thou sit&apos;st alone?
Why hast thou lost the fresh blood in thy cheeks;
And given my treasures and my rights of thee
To thick-eyed musing and cursed melancholy? 
In thy faint slumbers I by thee have watch&apos;d,
And heard thee murmur tales of iron wars;
Speak terms of manage to thy bounding steed;
Cry &apos;Courage! to the field!&apos; And thou hast talk&apos;d
Of sallies and retires, of trenches, tents, 
Of palisadoes, frontiers, parapets,
Of basilisks, of cannon, culverin,
Of prisoners&apos; ransom and of soldiers slain,
And all the currents of a heady fight.
Thy spirit within thee hath been so at war 
And thus hath so bestirr&apos;d thee in thy sleep,
That beads of sweat have stood upon thy brow
Like bubbles in a late-disturbed stream;
And in thy face strange motions have appear&apos;d,
Such as we see when men restrain their breath 
On some great sudden hest. O, what portents are these?
Some heavy business hath my lord in hand,
And I must know it, else he loves me not.</string>

		<string>With three or four loggerheads amongst three or four
score hogsheads. I have sounded the very
base-string of humility. Sirrah, I am sworn brother
to a leash of drawers; and can call them all by
their christen names, as Tom, Dick, and Francis.
They take it already upon their salvation, that
though I be but the prince of Wales, yet I am king
of courtesy; and tell me flatly I am no proud Jack,
like Falstaff, but a Corinthian, a lad of mettle, a
good boy, by the Lord, so they call me, and when I
am king of England, I shall command all the good
lads in Eastcheap. They call drinking deep, dyeing
scarlet; and when you breathe in your watering, they
cry &apos;hem!&apos; and bid you play it off. To conclude, I
am so good a proficient in one quarter of an hour,
that I can drink with any tinker in his own language
during my life. I tell thee, Ned, thou hast lost
much honour, that thou wert not with me in this sweet
action. But, sweet Ned,--to sweeten which name of
Ned, I give thee this pennyworth of sugar, clapped
even now into my hand by an under-skinker, one that
never spake other English in his life than &apos;Eight
shillings and sixpence&apos; and &apos;You are welcome,&apos; with
this shrill addition, &apos;Anon, anon, sir! Score a pint
of bastard in the Half-Moon,&apos; or so. But, Ned, to
drive away the time till Falstaff come, I prithee,
do thou stand in some by-room, while I question my
puny drawer to what end he gave me the sugar; and do
thou never leave calling &apos;Francis,&apos; that his tale
to me may be nothing but &apos;Anon.&apos; Step aside, and
I&apos;ll show thee a precedent.</string>

Whilst I at home starve for a merry look.
Hath homely age the alluring beauty took
From my poor cheek? then he hath wasted it:
Are my discourses dull? barren my wit?
If voluble and sharp discourse be marr&apos;d,
Unkindness blunts it more than marble hard:
Do their gay vestments his affections bait?
That&apos;s not my fault: he&apos;s master of my state:
What ruins are in me that can be found,

Of my defeatures. My decayed fair
A sunny look of his would soon repair
But, too unruly deer, he breaks the pale
And feeds from home; poor I am but his stale.</string>

		<string>Harry, I do not only marvel where thou spendest thy
time, but also how thou art accompanied: for though
the camomile, the more it is trodden on the faster
it grows, yet youth, the more it is wasted the
sooner it wears. That thou art my son, I have
partly thy mother&apos;s word, partly my own opinion,
but chiefly a villanous trick of thine eye and a
foolish-hanging of thy nether lip, that doth warrant
me. If then thou be son to me, here lies the point;
why, being son to me, art thou so pointed at? Shall
the blessed sun of heaven prove a micher and eat
blackberries? a question not to be asked. Shall
the sun of England prove a thief and take purses? a
question to be asked. There is a thing, Harry,
which thou hast often heard of and it is known to
many in our land by the name of pitch: this pitch,
as ancient writers do report, doth defile; so doth
the company thou keepest: for, Harry, now I do not
speak to thee in drink but in tears, not in
pleasure but in passion, not in words only, but in
woes also: and yet there is a virtuous man whom I
have often noted in thy company, but I know not his name.

[What manner of man, an it like your majesty?]

A goodly portly man, i&apos; faith, and a corpulent; of a
cheerful look, a pleasing eye and a most noble
carriage; and, as I think, his age some fifty, or,
by&apos;r lady, inclining to three score; and now I
remember me, his name is Falstaff: if that man
should be lewdly given, he deceiveth me; for, Harry,
I see virtue in his looks. If then the tree may be
known by the fruit, as the fruit by the tree, then,
peremptorily I speak it, there is virtue in that
Falstaff: him keep with, the rest banish. And tell
me now, thou naughty varlet, tell me, where hast
thou been this month?</string>

		<string>God pardon thee! yet let me wonder, Harry,
At thy affections, which do hold a wing
Quite from the flight of all thy ancestors.
Thy place in council thou hast rudely lost.
Which by thy younger brother is supplied,
And art almost an alien to the hearts
Of all the court and princes of my blood:
The hope and expectation of thy time
Is ruin&apos;d, and the soul of every man
Prophetically doth forethink thy fall.
Had I so lavish of my presence been,
So common-hackney&apos;d in the eyes of men,
So stale and cheap to vulgar company,
Opinion, that did help me to the crown,
Had still kept loyal to possession
And left me in reputeless banishment,
A fellow of no mark nor likelihood.
By being seldom seen, I could not stir
But like a comet I was wonder&apos;d at;
That men would tell their children &apos;This is he;&apos;
Others would say &apos;Where, which is Bolingbroke?&apos;
And then I stole all courtesy from heaven,
And dress&apos;d myself in such humility
That I did pluck allegiance from men&apos;s hearts,
Loud shouts and salutations from their mouths,
Even in the presence of the crowned king.
Thus did I keep my person fresh and new;
My presence, like a robe pontifical,
Ne&apos;er seen but wonder&apos;d at: and so my state,
Seldom but sumptuous, showed like a feast
And won by rareness such solemnity.
The skipping king, he ambled up and down
With shallow jesters and rash bavin wits,
Soon kindled and soon burnt; carded his state,
Mingled his royalty with capering fools,
Had his great name profaned with their scorns
And gave his countenance, against his name,
To laugh at gibing boys and stand the push
Of every beardless vain comparative,
Grew a companion to the common streets,
Enfeoff&apos;d himself to popularity;
That, being daily swallow&apos;d by men&apos;s eyes,
They surfeited with honey and began
To loathe the taste of sweetness, whereof a little
More than a little is by much too much.
So when he had occasion to be seen,
He was but as the cuckoo is in June,
Heard, not regarded; seen, but with such eyes
As, sick and blunted with community,
Afford no extraordinary gaze,
Such as is bent on sun-like majesty
When it shines seldom in admiring eyes;
But rather drowzed and hung their eyelids down,
Slept in his face and render&apos;d such aspect
As cloudy men use to their adversaries,
Being with his presence glutted, gorged and full.
And in that very line, Harry, standest thou;
For thou has lost thy princely privilege
With vile participation: not an eye
But is a-weary of thy common sight,
Save mine, which hath desired to see thee more;
Which now doth that I would not have it do,
Make blind itself with foolish tenderness.</string>

		<string>For all the world
As thou art to this hour was Richard then
When I from France set foot at Ravenspurgh,
And even as I was then is Percy now.
Now, by my sceptre and my soul to boot,
He hath more worthy interest to the state
Than thou the shadow of succession;
For of no right, nor colour like to right,
He doth fill fields with harness in the realm,
Turns head against the lion&apos;s armed jaws,
And, being no more in debt to years than thou,
Leads ancient lords and reverend bishops on
To bloody battles and to bruising arms.
What never-dying honour hath he got
Against renowned Douglas! whose high deeds,
Whose hot incursions and great name in arms
Holds from all soldiers chief majority
And military title capital
Through all the kingdoms that acknowledge Christ:
Thrice hath this Hotspur, Mars in swathling clothes,
This infant warrior, in his enterprises
Discomfited great Douglas, ta&apos;en him once,
Enlarged him and made a friend of him,
To fill the mouth of deep defiance up
And shake the peace and safety of our throne.
And what say you to this? Percy, Northumberland,
The Archbishop&apos;s grace of York, Douglas, Mortimer,
Capitulate against us and are up.
But wherefore do I tell these news to thee?
Why, Harry, do I tell thee of my foes,
Which art my near&apos;st and dearest enemy?
Thou that art like enough, through vassal fear,
Base inclination and the start of spleen
To fight against me under Percy&apos;s pay,
To dog his heels and curtsy at his frowns,
To show how much thou art degenerate.</string>

And God forgive them that so much have sway&apos;d
Your majesty&apos;s good thoughts away from me!
I will redeem all this on Percy&apos;s head
And in the closing of some glorious day
Be bold to tell you that I am your son;
When I will wear a garment all of blood
And stain my favours in a bloody mask,
Which, wash&apos;d away, shall scour my shame with it:
And that shall be the day, whene&apos;er it lights,
That this same child of honour and renown,
This gallant Hotspur, this all-praised knight,
And your unthought-of Harry chance to meet.
For every honour sitting on his helm,
Would they were multitudes, and on my head
My shames redoubled! for the time will come,
That I shall make this northern youth exchange
His glorious deeds for my indignities.
Percy is but my factor, good my lord,
To engross up glorious deeds on my behalf;
And I will call him to so strict account,
That he shall render every glory up,
Yea, even the slightest worship of his time,
Or I will tear the reckoning from his heart.
This, in the name of God, I promise here:
The which if He be pleased I shall perform,
I do beseech your majesty may salve
The long-grown wounds of my intemperance:
If not, the end of life cancels all bands;
And I will die a hundred thousand deaths
Ere break the smallest parcel of this vow.</string>

		<string>If I be not ashamed of my soldiers, I am a soused
gurnet. I have misused the king&apos;s press damnably.
I have got, in exchange of a hundred and fifty
soldiers, three hundred and odd pounds. I press me
none but good house-holders, yeoman&apos;s sons; inquire
me out contracted bachelors, such as had been asked
twice on the banns; such a commodity of warm slaves,
as had as lieve hear the devil as a drum; such as
fear the report of a caliver worse than a struck
fowl or a hurt wild-duck. I pressed me none but such
toasts-and-butter, with hearts in their bellies no
bigger than pins&apos; heads, and they have bought out
their services; and now my whole charge consists of
ancients, corporals, lieutenants, gentlemen of
companies, slaves as ragged as Lazarus in the
painted cloth, where the glutton&apos;s dogs licked his
sores; and such as indeed were never soldiers, but
discarded unjust serving-men, younger sons to
younger brothers, revolted tapsters and ostlers
trade-fallen, the cankers of a calm world and a
long peace, ten times more dishonourable ragged than
an old faced ancient: and such have I, to fill up
the rooms of them that have bought out their
services, that you would think that I had a hundred
and fifty tattered prodigals lately come from
swine-keeping, from eating draff and husks. A mad
fellow met me on the way and told me I had unloaded
all the gibbets and pressed the dead bodies. No eye
hath seen such scarecrows. I&apos;ll not march through
Coventry with them, that&apos;s flat: nay, and the
villains march wide betwixt the legs, as if they had
gyves on; for indeed I had the most of them out of
prison. There&apos;s but a shirt and a half in all my
company; and the half shirt is two napkins tacked
together and thrown over the shoulders like an
herald&apos;s coat without sleeves; and the shirt, to say
the truth, stolen from my host at Saint Alban&apos;s, or
the red-nose innkeeper of Daventry. But that&apos;s all
one; they&apos;ll find linen enough on every hedge.</string>

		<string>The king is kind; and well we know the king
Knows at what time to promise, when to pay.
My father and my uncle and myself
Did give him that same royalty he wears;
And when he was not six and twenty strong,
Sick in the world&apos;s regard, wretched and low,
A poor unminded outlaw sneaking home,
My father gave him welcome to the shore;
And when he heard him swear and vow to God
He came but to be Duke of Lancaster,
To sue his livery and beg his peace,
With tears of innocency and terms of zeal,
My father, in kind heart and pity moved,
Swore him assistance and perform&apos;d it too.
Now when the lords and barons of the realm
Perceived Northumberland did lean to him,
The more and less came in with cap and knee;
Met him in boroughs, cities, villages,
Attended him on bridges, stood in lanes,
Laid gifts before him, proffer&apos;d him their oaths,
Gave him their heirs, as pages follow&apos;d him
Even at the heels in golden multitudes.
He presently, as greatness knows itself,
Steps me a little higher than his vow
Made to my father, while his blood was poor,
Upon the naked shore at Ravenspurgh;
And now, forsooth, takes on him to reform
Some certain edicts and some strait decrees
That lie too heavy on the commonwealth,
Cries out upon abuses, seems to weep
Over his country&apos;s wrongs; and by this face,
This seeming brow of justice, did he win
The hearts of all that he did angle for;
Proceeded further; cut me off the heads
Of all the favourites that the absent king
In deputation left behind him here,
When he was personal in the Irish war.

[Tut, I came not to hear this.]

Then to the point.
In short time after, he deposed the king;
Soon after that, deprived him of his life;
And in the neck of that, task&apos;d the whole state:
To make that worse, suffer&apos;d his kinsman March,
Who is, if every owner were well placed,
Indeed his king, to be engaged in Wales,
There without ransom to lie forfeited;
Disgraced me in my happy victories,
Sought to entrap me by intelligence;
Rated mine uncle from the council-board;
In rage dismiss&apos;d my father from the court;
Broke oath on oath, committed wrong on wrong,
And in conclusion drove us to seek out
This head of safety; and withal to pry
Into his title, the which we find
Too indirect for long continuance.

		<string>It pleased your majesty to turn your looks
Of favour from myself and all our house;
And yet I must remember you, my lord,
We were the first and dearest of your friends.
For you my staff of office did I break
In Richard&apos;s time; and posted day and night
to meet you on the way, and kiss your hand,
When yet you were in place and in account
Nothing so strong and fortunate as I.
It was myself, my brother and his son,
That brought you home and boldly did outdare
The dangers of the time. You swore to us,
And you did swear that oath at Doncaster,
That you did nothing purpose &apos;gainst the state;
Nor claim no further than your new-fall&apos;n right,
The seat of Gaunt, dukedom of Lancaster:
To this we swore our aid. But in short space
It rain&apos;d down fortune showering on your head;
And such a flood of greatness fell on you,
What with our help, what with the absent king,
What with the injuries of a wanton time,
The seeming sufferances that you had borne,
And the contrarious winds that held the king
So long in his unlucky Irish wars
That all in England did repute him dead:
And from this swarm of fair advantages
You took occasion to be quickly woo&apos;d
To gripe the general sway into your hand;
Forget your oath to us at Doncaster;
And being fed by us you used us so
As that ungentle hull, the cuckoo&apos;s bird,
Useth the sparrow; did oppress our nest;
Grew by our feeding to so great a bulk
That even our love durst not come near your sight
For fear of swallowing; but with nimble wing
We were enforced, for safety sake, to fly
Out of sight and raise this present head;
Whereby we stand opposed by such means
As you yourself have forged against yourself
By unkind usage, dangerous countenance,
And violation of all faith and troth
Sworn to us in your younger enterprise.</string>

		<string>Then are we all undone.
It is not possible, it cannot be,
The king should keep his word in loving us;
He will suspect us still and find a time
To punish this offence in other faults:
Suspicion all our lives shall be stuck full of eyes;
For treason is but trusted like the fox,
Who, ne&apos;er so tame, so cherish&apos;d and lock&apos;d up,
Will have a wild trick of his ancestors.
Look how we can, or sad or merrily,
Interpretation will misquote our looks,
And we shall feed like oxen at a stall,
The better cherish&apos;d, still the nearer death.
My nephew&apos;s trespass may be well forgot;
it hath the excuse of youth and heat of blood,
And an adopted name of privilege,
A hair-brain&apos;d Hotspur, govern&apos;d by a spleen:
All his offences live upon my head
And on his father&apos;s; we did train him on,
And, his corruption being ta&apos;en from us,
We, as the spring of all, shall pay for all.
Therefore, good cousin, let not Harry know,
In any case, the offer of the king.</string>

		<string>No, by my soul; I never in my life
Did hear a challenge urged more modestly,
Unless a brother should a brother dare
To gentle exercise and proof of arms.
He gave you all the duties of a man;
Trimm&apos;d up your praises with a princely tongue,
Spoke to your deservings like a chronicle,
Making you ever better than his praise
By still dispraising praise valued in you;
And, which became him like a prince indeed,
He made a blushing cital of himself;
And chid his truant youth with such a grace
As if he master&apos;d there a double spirit.
Of teaching and of learning instantly.
There did he pause: but let me tell the world,
If he outlive the envy of this day,
England did never owe so sweet a hope,
So much misconstrued in his wantonness.</string>

Some other mistress hath thy sweet aspects;
I am not Adriana nor thy wife.
The time was once when thou unurged wouldst vow
That never words were music to thine ear,
That never object pleasing in thine eye,
That never touch well welcome to thy hand,
That never meat sweet-savor&apos;d in thy taste,
Unless I spake, or look&apos;d, or touch&apos;d, or carved to thee.
How comes it now, my husband, O, how comes it,
That thou art thus estranged from thyself?
Thyself I call it, being strange to me,
That, undividable, incorporate,
Am better than thy dear self&apos;s better part.
Ah, do not tear away thyself from me!
For know, my love, as easy mayest thou fall
A drop of water in the breaking gulf,
And take unmingled that same drop again,
Without addition or diminishing,
As take from me thyself and not me too.
How dearly would it touch me to the quick,
Shouldst thou but hear I were licentious
And that this body, consecrate to thee,
By ruffian lust should be contaminate!
Wouldst thou not spit at me and spurn at me
And hurl the name of husband in my face
And tear the stain&apos;d skin off my harlot-brow
And from my false hand cut the wedding-ring
And break it with a deep-divorcing vow?
I know thou canst; and therefore see thou do it.
I am possess&apos;d with an adulterate blot;
My blood is mingled with the crime of lust:
For if we too be one and thou play false,
I do digest the poison of thy flesh,
Being strumpeted by thy contagion.
Keep then far league and truce with thy true bed;
I live unstain&apos;d, thou undishonoured.</string>

Ill-weaved ambition, how much art thou shrunk!
When that this body did contain a spirit,
A kingdom for it was too small a bound;
But now two paces of the vilest earth
Is room enough: this earth that bears thee dead
Bears not alive so stout a gentleman.
If thou wert sensible of courtesy,
I should not make so dear a show of zeal:
But let my favours hide thy mangled face;
And, even in thy behalf, I&apos;ll thank myself
For doing these fair rites of tenderness.
Adieu, and take thy praise with thee to heaven!
Thy ignominy sleep with thee in the grave,
But not remember&apos;d in thy epitaph!

[He spieth FALSTAFF on the ground]
What, old acquaintance! could not all this flesh
Keep in a little life? Poor Jack, farewell!
I could have better spared a better man:
O, I should have a heavy miss of thee,
If I were much in love with vanity!
Death hath not struck so fat a deer to-day,
Though many dearer, in this bloody fray.
Embowell&apos;d will I see thee by and by:

		<string>Open your ears; for which of you will stop
The vent of hearing when loud Rumour speaks?
I, from the orient to the drooping west,
Making the wind my post-horse, still unfold
The acts commenced on this ball of earth:
Upon my tongues continual slanders ride,
The which in every language I pronounce,
Stuffing the ears of men with false reports.
I speak of peace, while covert enmity
Under the smile of safety wounds the world:
And who but Rumour, who but only I,
Make fearful musters and prepared defence,
Whiles the big year, swoln with some other grief,
Is thought with child by the stern tyrant war,
And no such matter? Rumour is a pipe
Blown by surmises, jealousies, conjectures
And of so easy and so plain a stop
That the blunt monster with uncounted heads,
The still-discordant wavering multitude,
Can play upon it. But what need I thus
My well-known body to anatomize
Among my household? Why is Rumour here?
I run before King Harry&apos;s victory;
Who in a bloody field by Shrewsbury
Hath beaten down young Hotspur and his troops,
Quenching the flame of bold rebellion
Even with the rebel&apos;s blood. But what mean I
To speak so true at first? my office is
To noise abroad that Harry Monmouth fell
Under the wrath of noble Hotspur&apos;s sword,
And that the king before the Douglas&apos; rage
Stoop&apos;d his anointed head as low as death.
This have I rumour&apos;d through the peasant towns
Between that royal field of Shrewsbury
And this worm-eaten hold of ragged stone,
Where Hotspur&apos;s father, old Northumberland,
Lies crafty-sick: the posts come tiring on,
And not a man of them brings other news
Than they have learn&apos;d of me: from Rumour&apos;s tongues
They bring smooth comforts false, worse than
true wrongs.</string>

Let heaven kiss earth! now let not Nature&apos;s hand

And let this world no longer be a stage
To feed contention in a lingering act;
But let one spirit of the first-born Cain
Reign in all bosoms, that, each heart being set
On bloody courses, the rude scene may end,

		<string>The lives of all your loving complices
Lean on your health; the which, if you give o&apos;er
To stormy passion, must perforce decay.
You cast the event of war, my noble lord,
And summ&apos;d the account of chance, before you said
&apos;Let us make head.&apos; It was your presurmise,
That, in the dole of blows, your son might drop:
You knew he walk&apos;d o&apos;er perils, on an edge,
More likely to fall in than to get o&apos;er;
You were advised his flesh was capable
Of wounds and scars and that his forward spirit
Would lift him where most trade of danger ranged:
Yet did you say &apos;Go forth;&apos; and none of this,
Though strongly apprehended, could restrain
The stiff-borne action: what hath then befallen,
Or what hath this bold enterprise brought forth,
More than that being which was like to be?

[LORD BARDOLPH
We all that are engaged to this loss
Knew that we ventured on such dangerous seas
That if we wrought our life &apos;twas ten to one;
And yet we ventured, for the gain proposed
Choked the respect of likely peril fear&apos;d;
And since we are o&apos;erset, venture again.
Come, we will all put forth, body and goods.]

&apos;Tis more than time: and, my most noble lord,
I hear for certain, and do speak the truth,
The gentle Archbishop of York is up
With well-appointed powers: he is a man
Who with a double surety binds his followers.
My lord your son had only but the corpse,
But shadows and the shows of men, to fight;
For that same word, rebellion, did divide
The action of their bodies from their souls;
And they did fight with queasiness, constrain&apos;d,
As men drink potions, that their weapons only
Seem&apos;d on our side; but, for their spirits and souls,
This word, rebellion, it had froze them up,
As fish are in a pond. But now the bishop
Turns insurrection to religion:
Supposed sincere and holy in his thoughts,
He&apos;s followed both with body and with mind;
And doth enlarge his rising with the blood
Of fair King Richard, scraped from Pomfret stones;
Derives from heaven his quarrel and his cause;
Tells them he doth bestride a bleeding land,
Gasping for life under great Bolingbroke;
And more and less do flock to follow him.</string>

		<string>[But, by your leave, it never yet did hurt
To lay down likelihoods and forms of hope.]

Yes, if this present quality of war,
Indeed the instant action: a cause on foot
Lives so in hope as in an early spring
We see the appearing buds; which to prove fruit,
Hope gives not so much warrant as despair
That frosts will bite them. When we mean to build,
We first survey the plot, then draw the model;
And when we see the figure of the house,
Then must we rate the cost of the erection;
Which if we find outweighs ability,
What do we then but draw anew the model
In fewer offices, or at last desist
To build at all? Much more, in this great work,
Which is almost to pluck a kingdom down
And set another up, should we survey
The plot of situation and the model,
Consent upon a sure foundation,
Question surveyors, know our own estate,
How able such a work to undergo,
To weigh against his opposite; or else
We fortify in paper and in figures,
Using the names of men instead of men:
Like one that draws the model of a house
Beyond his power to build it; who, half through,
Gives o&apos;er and leaves his part-created cost
A naked subject to the weeping clouds
And waste for churlish winter&apos;s tyranny.</string>

Herein you war against your reputation
And draw within the compass of suspect
The unviolated honour of your wife.
Once this,--your long experience of her wisdom,
Her sober virtue, years and modesty,
Plead on her part some cause to you unknown:
And doubt not, sir, but she will well excuse
Why at this time the doors are made against you.
Be ruled by me: depart in patience,
And let us to the Tiger all to dinner,
And about evening come yourself alone
To know the reason of this strange restraint.
If by strong hand you offer to break in
Now in the stirring passage of the day,
A vulgar comment will be made of it,
And that supposed by the common rout
Against your yet ungalled estimation
That may with foul intrusion enter in
And dwell upon your grave when you are dead;
For slander lives upon succession,
For ever housed where it gets possession.</string>

		<string>O yet, for God&apos;s sake, go not to these wars!
The time was, father, that you broke your word,
When you were more endeared to it than now;
When your own Percy, when my heart&apos;s dear Harry,
Threw many a northward look to see his father
Bring up his powers; but he did long in vain.
Who then persuaded you to stay at home?
There were two honours lost, yours and your son&apos;s.
For yours, the God of heaven brighten it!
For his, it stuck upon him as the sun
In the grey vault of heaven, and by his light
Did all the chivalry of England move
To do brave acts: he was indeed the glass
Wherein the noble youth did dress themselves:
He had no legs that practised not his gait;
And speaking thick, which nature made his blemish,
Became the accents of the valiant;
For those that could speak low and tardily
Would turn their own perfection to abuse,
To seem like him: so that in speech, in gait,
In diet, in affections of delight,
In military rules, humours of blood,
He was the mark and glass, copy and book,
That fashion&apos;d others. And him, O wondrous him!
O miracle of men! him did you leave,
Second to none, unseconded by you,
To look upon the hideous god of war
In disadvantage; to abide a field
Where nothing but the sound of Hotspur&apos;s name
Did seem defensible: so you left him.
Never, O never, do his ghost the wrong
To hold your honour more precise and nice
With others than with him! let them alone:
The marshal and the archbishop are strong:
Had my sweet Harry had but half their numbers,
To-day might I, hanging on Hotspur&apos;s neck,
Have talk&apos;d of Monmouth&apos;s grave.</string>

Nature&apos;s soft nurse, how have I frighted thee,
That thou no more wilt weigh my eyelids down
And steep my senses in forgetfulness?
Why rather, sleep, liest thou in smoky cribs,
Upon uneasy pallets stretching thee
And hush&apos;d with buzzing night-flies to thy slumber,
Than in the perfumed chambers of the great,
Under the canopies of costly state,
And lull&apos;d with sound of sweetest melody?
O thou dull god, why liest thou with the vile
In loathsome beds, and leavest the kingly couch
A watch-case or a common &apos;larum-bell?
Wilt thou upon the high and giddy mast
Seal up the ship-boy&apos;s eyes, and rock his brains
In cradle of the rude imperious surge
And in the visitation of the winds,
Who take the ruffian billows by the top,
Curling their monstrous heads and hanging them
With deafening clamour in the slippery clouds,
That, with the hurly, death itself awakes?
Canst thou, O partial sleep, give thy repose
To the wet sea-boy in an hour so rude,
And in the calmest and most stillest night,
With all appliances and means to boot,
Deny it to a king? Then happy low, lie down!
Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown.</string>

		<string>O God! that one might read the book of fate,
And see the revolution of the times
Make mountains level, and the continent,
Weary of solid firmness, melt itself
Into the sea! and, other times, to see
The beachy girdle of the ocean
Too wide for Neptune&apos;s hips; how chances mock,
And changes fill the cup of alteration
With divers liquors! O, if this were seen,
The happiest youth, viewing his progress through,
What perils past, what crosses to ensue,
Would shut the book, and sit him down and die.
&apos;Tis not &apos;ten years gone
Since Richard and Northumberland, great friends,
Did feast together, and in two years after
Were they at wars: it is but eight years since
This Percy was the man nearest my soul,
Who like a brother toil&apos;d in my affairs
And laid his love and life under my foot,
Yea, for my sake, even to the eyes of Richard
Gave him defiance. But which of you was by--
You, cousin Nevil, as I may remember--

[To WARWICK]

When Richard, with his eye brimful of tears,
Then cheque&apos;d and rated by Northumberland,
Did speak these words, now proved a prophecy?
&apos;Northumberland, thou ladder by the which
My cousin Bolingbroke ascends my throne;&apos;
Though then, God knows, I had no such intent,
But that necessity so bow&apos;d the state
That I and greatness were compell&apos;d to kiss:
&apos;The time shall come,&apos; thus did he follow it,
&apos;The time will come, that foul sin, gathering head,
Shall break into corruption:&apos; so went on,
Foretelling this same time&apos;s condition
And the division of our amity.</string>

hath done about Turnbull Street: and every third
word a lie, duer paid to the hearer than the Turk&apos;s

man made after supper of a cheese-paring: when a&apos;
was naked, he was, for all the world, like a forked
radish, with a head fantastically carved upon it
with a knife: a&apos; was so forlorn, that his
dimensions to any thick sight were invincible: a&apos;
was the very genius of famine; yet lecherous as a
monkey, and the whores called him mandrake: a&apos; came
ever in the rearward of the fashion, and sung those
tunes to the overscutched huswives that he heard the
carmen whistle, and swear they were his fancies or
his good-nights. And now is this Vice&apos;s dagger
become a squire, and talks as familiarly of John a
Gaunt as if he had been sworn brother to him; and
I&apos;ll be sworn a&apos; ne&apos;er saw him but once in the
Tilt-yard; and then he burst his head for crowding
among the marshal&apos;s men. I saw it, and told John a
Gaunt he beat his own name; for you might have
thrust him and all his apparel into an eel-skin; the
case of a treble hautboy was a mansion for him, a
court: and now has he land and beefs. Well, I&apos;ll
be acquainted with him, if I return; and it shall
go hard but I will make him a philosopher&apos;s two
stones to me: if the young dace be a bait for the
old pike, I see no reason in the law of nature but I
may snap at him. Let time shape, and there an end.</string>

You, reverend father, and these noble lords
Had not been here, to dress the ugly form

With your fair honours. You, lord archbishop,
Whose see is by a civil peace maintained,
Whose beard the silver hand of peace hath touch&apos;d,
Whose learning and good letters peace hath tutor&apos;d,
Whose white investments figure innocence,
The dove and very blessed spirit of peace,
Wherefore do you so ill translate ourself
Out of the speech of peace that bears such grace,
Into the harsh and boisterous tongue of war;
Turning your books to graves, your ink to blood,
Your pens to lances and your tongue divine
To a trumpet and a point of war?</string>

		<string>Wherefore do I this? so the question stands.
Briefly to this end: we are all diseased,
And with our surfeiting and wanton hours
Have brought ourselves into a burning fever,
And we must bleed for it; of which disease
Our late king, Richard, being infected, died.
But, my most noble Lord of Westmoreland,
I take not on me here as a physician,
Nor do I as an enemy to peace
Troop in the throngs of military men;
But rather show awhile like fearful war,
To diet rank minds sick of happiness
And purge the obstructions which begin to stop
Our very veins of life. Hear me more plainly.
I have in equal balance justly weigh&apos;d
What wrongs our arms may do, what wrongs we suffer,
And find our griefs heavier than our offences.
We see which way the stream of time doth run,
And are enforced from our most quiet there
By the rough torrent of occasion;
And have the summary of all our griefs,
When time shall serve, to show in articles;
Which long ere this we offer&apos;d to the king,
And might by no suit gain our audience:
When we are wrong&apos;d and would unfold our griefs,
We are denied access unto his person
Even by those men that most have done us wrong.
The dangers of the days but newly gone,
Whose memory is written on the earth
With yet appearing blood, and the examples
Of every minute&apos;s instance, present now,
Hath put us in these ill-beseeming arms,
Not to break peace or any branch of it,
But to establish here a peace indeed,
Concurring both in name and quality.</string>

Than now to see you here an iron man,
Cheering a rout of rebels with your drum,

How deep you were within the books of God?

Between the grace, the sanctities of heaven
And our dull workings. O, who shall believe
But you misuse the reverence of your place,
Employ the countenance and grace of heaven,
As a false favourite doth his prince&apos;s name,

		<string>And may it be that you have quite forgot
A husband&apos;s office? shall, Antipholus.
Even in the spring of love, thy love-springs rot?
Shall love, in building, grow so ruinous?
If you did wed my sister for her wealth,
Then for her wealth&apos;s sake use her with more kindness:
Or if you like elsewhere, do it by stealth;
Muffle your false love with some show of blindness:
Let not my sister read it in your eye;
Be not thy tongue thy own shame&apos;s orator;
Look sweet, be fair, become disloyalty;
Apparel vice like virtue&apos;s harbinger;
Bear a fair presence, though your heart be tainted;
Teach sin the carriage of a holy saint;
Be secret-false: what need she be acquainted?
What simple thief brags of his own attaint?
&apos;Tis double wrong, to truant with your bed
And let her read it in thy looks at board:
Shame hath a bastard fame, well managed;
Ill d eeds are doubled with an evil word.
Alas, poor women! make us but believe,
Being compact of credit, that you love us;
Though others have the arm, show us the sleeve;
We in your motion turn and you may move us.
Then, gentle brother, get you in again;
Comfort my sister, cheer her, call her wife:
&apos;Tis holy sport to be a little vain,
When the sweet breath of flattery conquers strife.</string>

		<string>Nothing but well to thee, Thomas of Clarence.
How chance thou art not with the prince thy brother?
He loves thee, and thou dost neglect him, Thomas;
Thou hast a better place in his affection
Than all thy brothers: cherish it, my boy,
And noble offices thou mayst effect
Of mediation, after I am dead,
Between his greatness and thy other brethren:
Therefore omit him not; blunt not his love,
Nor lose the good advantage of his grace
By seeming cold or careless of his will;
For he is gracious, if he be observed:
He hath a tear for pity and a hand
Open as day for melting charity:
Yet notwithstanding, being incensed, he&apos;s flint,
As humorous as winter and as sudden
As flaws congealed in the spring of day.
His temper, therefore, must be well observed:
Chide him for faults, and do it reverently,
When thou perceive his blood inclined to mirth;
But, being moody, give him line and scope,
Till that his passions, like a whale on ground,
Confound themselves with working. Learn this, Thomas,
And thou shalt prove a shelter to thy friends,
A hoop of gold to bind thy brothers in,
That the united vessel of their blood,
Mingled with venom of suggestion--
As, force perforce, the age will pour it in--
Shall never leak, though it do work as strong
As aconitum or rash gunpowder.</string>

Being so troublesome a bedfellow?
O polish&apos;d perturbation! golden care!
That keep&apos;st the ports of slumber open wide
To many a watchful night! sleep with it now!
Yet not so sound and half so deeply sweet
As he whose brow with homely biggen bound
Snores out the watch of night. O majesty!
When thou dost pinch thy bearer, thou dost sit
Like a rich armour worn in heat of day,
That scalds with safety. By his gates of breath
There lies a downy feather which stirs not:
Did he suspire, that light and weightless down
Perforce must move. My gracious lord! my father!
This sleep is sound indeed, this is a sleep
That from this golden rigol hath divorced
So many English kings. Thy due from me
Is tears and heavy sorrows of the blood,
Which nature, love, and filial tenderness,
Shall, O dear father, pay thee plenteously:
My due from thee is this imperial crown,
Which, as immediate as thy place and blood,
Derives itself to me. Lo, here it sits,
Which God shall guard: and put the world&apos;s whole strength
Into one giant arm, it shall not force
This lineal honour from me: this from thee
Will I to mine leave, as &apos;tis left to me.</string>

		<string>Thy wish was father, Harry, to that thought:
I stay too long by thee, I weary thee.
Dost thou so hunger for mine empty chair
That thou wilt needs invest thee with my honours
Before thy hour be ripe? O foolish youth!
Thou seek&apos;st the greatness that will o&apos;erwhelm thee.
Stay but a little; for my cloud of dignity
Is held from falling with so weak a wind
That it will quickly drop: my day is dim.
Thou hast stolen that which after some few hours
Were thine without offence; and at my death
Thou hast seal&apos;d up my expectation:
Thy life did manifest thou lovedst me not,
And thou wilt have me die assured of it.
Thou hidest a thousand daggers in thy thoughts,
Which thou hast whetted on thy stony heart,
To stab at half an hour of my life.
What! canst thou not forbear me half an hour?
Then get thee gone and dig my grave thyself,
And bid the merry bells ring to thine ear
That thou art crowned, not that I am dead.
Let all the tears that should bedew my hearse
Be drops of balm to sanctify thy head:
Only compound me with forgotten dust
Give that which gave thee life unto the worms.
Pluck down my officers, break my decrees;
For now a time is come to mock at form:
Harry the Fifth is crown&apos;d: up, vanity!
Down, royal state! all you sage counsellors, hence!
And to the English court assemble now,
From every region, apes of idleness!
Now, neighbour confines, purge you of your scum:
Have you a ruffian that will swear, drink, dance,
Revel the night, rob, murder, and commit
The oldest sins the newest kind of ways?
Be happy, he will trouble you no more;
England shall double gild his treble guilt,
England shall give him office, honour, might;
For the fifth Harry from curb&apos;d licence plucks
The muzzle of restraint, and the wild dog
Shall flesh his tooth on every innocent.
O my poor kingdom, sick with civil blows!
When that my care could not withhold thy riots,
What wilt thou do when riot is thy care?
O, thou wilt be a wilderness again,
Peopled with wolves, thy old inhabitants!</string>

		<string>O, pardon me, my liege! but for my tears,
The moist impediments unto my speech,
I had forestall&apos;d this dear and deep rebuke
Ere you with grief had spoke and I had heard
The course of it so far. There is your crown;
And He that wears the crown immortally
Long guard it yours! If I affect it more
Than as your honour and as your renown,
Let me no more from this obedience rise,
Which my most inward true and duteous spirit
Teacheth, this prostrate and exterior bending.
God witness with me, when I here came in,
And found no course of breath within your majesty,
How cold it struck my heart! If I do feign,
O, let me in my present wildness die
And never live to show the incredulous world
The noble change that I have purposed!
Coming to look on you, thinking you dead,
And dead almost, my liege, to think you were,
I spake unto this crown as having sense,
And thus upbraided it: &apos;The care on thee depending
Hath fed upon the body of my father;
Therefore, thou best of gold art worst of gold:
Other, less fine in carat, is more precious,
Preserving life in medicine potable;
But thou, most fine, most honour&apos;d: most renown&apos;d,
Hast eat thy bearer up.&apos; Thus, my most royal liege,
Accusing it, I put it on my head,
To try with it, as with an enemy
That had before my face murder&apos;d my father,
The quarrel of a true inheritor.
But if it did infect my blood with joy,
Or swell my thoughts to any strain of pride;
If any rebel or vain spirit of mine
Did with the least affection of a welcome
Give entertainment to the might of it,
Let God for ever keep it from my head
And make me as the poorest vassal is
That doth with awe and terror kneel to it!</string>

		<string>O my son,
God put it in thy mind to take it hence,
That thou mightst win the more thy father&apos;s love,
Pleading so wisely in excuse of it!
Come hither, Harry, sit thou by my bed;
And hear, I think, the very latest counsel
That ever I shall breathe. God knows, my son,
By what by-paths and indirect crook&apos;d ways
I met this crown; and I myself know well
How troublesome it sat upon my head.
To thee it shall descend with bitter quiet,
Better opinion, better confirmation;
For all the soil of the achievement goes
With me into the earth. It seem&apos;d in me
But as an honour snatch&apos;d with boisterous hand,
And I had many living to upbraid
My gain of it by their assistances;
Which daily grew to quarrel and to bloodshed,
Wounding supposed peace: all these bold fears
Thou see&apos;st with peril I have answered;
For all my reign hath been but as a scene
Acting that argument: and now my death
Changes the mode; for what in me was purchased,
Falls upon thee in a more fairer sort;
So thou the garland wear&apos;st successively.
Yet, though thou stand&apos;st more sure than I could do,
Thou art not firm enough, since griefs are green;
And all my friends, which thou must make thy friends,
Have but their stings and teeth newly ta&apos;en out;
By whose fell working I was first advanced
And by whose power I well might lodge a fear
To be again displaced: which to avoid,
I cut them off; and had a purpose now
To lead out many to the Holy Land,
Lest rest and lying still might make them look
Too near unto my state. Therefore, my Harry,
Be it thy course to busy giddy minds
With foreign quarrels; that action, hence borne out,
May waste the memory of the former days.
More would I, but my lungs are wasted so
That strength of speech is utterly denied me.
How I came by the crown, O God forgive;
And grant it may with thee in true peace live!</string>

		<string>If I were sawed into quantities, I should make four
dozen of such bearded hermits&apos; staves as Master
Shallow. It is a wonderful thing to see the
semblable coherence of his men&apos;s spirits and his:
they, by observing of him, do bear themselves like
foolish justices; he, by conversing with them, is
turned into a justice-like serving-man: their
spirits are so married in conjunction with the
participation of society that they flock together in
consent, like so many wild-geese. If I had a suit
to Master Shallow, I would humour his men with the
imputation of being near their master: if to his
men, I would curry with Master Shallow that no man
could better command his servants. It is certain
that either wise bearing or ignorant carriage is
caught, as men take diseases, one of another:
therefore let men take heed of their company. I
will devise matter enough out of this Shallow to
keep Prince Harry in continual laughter the wearing
out of six fashions, which is four terms, or two
actions, and a&apos; shall laugh without intervallums. O,
it is much that a lie with a slight oath and a jest
with a sad brow will do with a fellow that never
had the ache in his shoulders! O, you shall see him
laugh till his face be like a wet cloak ill laid up!</string>

Brothers, you mix your sadness with some fear:
This is the English, not the Turkish court;

But Harry Harry. Yet be sad, good brothers,
For, by my faith, it very well becomes you:
Sorrow so royally in you appears
That I will deeply put the fashion on
And wear it in my heart: why then, be sad;
But entertain no more of it, good brothers,
Than a joint burden laid upon us all.
For me, by heaven, I bid you be assured,
I&apos;ll be your father and your brother too;
Let me but bear your love, I &apos;ll bear your cares:
Yet weep that Harry&apos;s dead; and so will I;
But Harry lives, that shall convert those tears
By number into hours of happiness.</string>

Therefore still bear the balance and the sword:
And I do wish your honours may increase,
Till you do live to see a son of mine
Offend you and obey you, as I did.
So shall I live to speak my father&apos;s words:
&apos;Happy am I, that have a man so bold,
That dares do justice on my proper son;
And not less happy, having such a son,
That would deliver up his greatness so
Into the hands of justice.&apos; You did commit me:
For which, I do commit into your hand
The unstained sword that you have used to bear;
With this remembrance, that you use the same
With the like bold, just and impartial spirit
As you have done &apos;gainst me. There is my hand.
You shall be as a father to my youth:
My voice shall sound as you do prompt mine ear,
And I will stoop and humble my intents
To your well-practised wise directions.
And, princes all, believe me, I beseech you;
My father is gone wild into his grave,
For in his tomb lie my affections;
And with his spirit sadly I survive,
To mock the expectation of the world,
To frustrate prophecies and to raze out
Rotten opinion, who hath writ me down
After my seeming. The tide of blood in me
Hath proudly flow&apos;d in vanity till now:
Now doth it turn and ebb back to the sea,
Where it shall mingle with the state of floods
And flow henceforth in formal majesty.
Now call we our high court of parliament:
And let us choose such limbs of noble counsel,
That the great body of our state may go
In equal rank with the best govern&apos;d nation;
That war, or peace, or both at once, may be
As things acquainted and familiar to us;
In which you, father, shall have foremost hand.
Our coronation done, we will accite,
As I before remember&apos;d, all our state:
And, God consigning to my good intents,
No prince nor peer shall have just cause to say,
God shorten Harry&apos;s happy life one day!</string>

		<string>Sweet mistress--what your name is else, I know not,
Nor by what wonder you do hit of mine,--
Less in your knowledge and your grace you show not
Than our earth&apos;s wonder, more than earth divine.
Teach me, dear creature, how to think and speak;
Lay open to my earthy-gross conceit,
Smother&apos;d in errors, feeble, shallow, weak,
The folded meaning of your words&apos; deceit.
Against my soul&apos;s pure truth why labour you
To make it wander in an unknown field?
Are you a god? would you create me new?
Transform me then, and to your power I&apos;ll yield.
But if that I am I, then well I know
Your weeping sister is no wife of mine,
Nor to her bed no homage do I owe
Far more, far more to you do I decline.
O, train me not, sweet mermaid, with thy note,
To drown me in thy sister&apos;s flood of tears:
Sing, siren, for thyself and I will dote:
Spread o&apos;er the silver waves thy golden hairs,
And as a bed I&apos;ll take them and there lie,
And in that glorious supposition think
He gains by death that hath such means to die:
Let Love, being light, be drowned if she sink!</string>

		<string>I know thee not, old man: fall to thy prayers;
How ill white hairs become a fool and jester!
I have long dream&apos;d of such a kind of man,
So surfeit-swell&apos;d, so old and so profane;
But, being awaked, I do despise my dream.
Make less thy body hence, and more thy grace;
Leave gormandizing; know the grave doth gape
For thee thrice wider than for other men.
Reply not to me with a fool-born jest:
Presume not that I am the thing I was;
For God doth know, so shall the world perceive,
That I have turn&apos;d away my former self;
So will I those that kept me company.
When thou dost hear I am as I have been,
Approach me, and thou shalt be as thou wast,
The tutor and the feeder of my riots:
Till then, I banish thee, on pain of death,
As I have done the rest of my misleaders,
Not to come near our person by ten mile.
For competence of life I will allow you,
That lack of means enforce you not to evil:
And, as we hear you do reform yourselves,
We will, according to your strengths and qualities,
Give you advancement. </string>

So great an object: can this cockpit hold
The vasty fields of France? or may we cram
Within this wooden O the very casques
That did affright the air at Agincourt?
O, pardon! since a crooked figure may
Attest in little place a million;
And let us, ciphers to this great accompt,

Suppose within the girdle of these walls
Are now confined two mighty monarchies,
Whose high upreared and abutting fronts
The perilous narrow ocean parts asunder:
Piece out our imperfections with your thoughts;
Into a thousand parts divide on man,
And make imaginary puissance;
Think when we talk of horses, that you see them
Printing their proud hoofs i&apos; the receiving earth;
For &apos;tis your thoughts that now must deck our kings,
Carry them here and there; jumping o&apos;er times,
Turning the accomplishment of many years
Into an hour-glass: for the which supply,
Admit me Chorus to this history;

Gently to hear, kindly to judge, our play.</string>

List his discourse of war, and you shall hear
A fearful battle render&apos;d you in music:
Turn him to any cause of policy,
The Gordian knot of it he will unloose,
Familiar as his garter: that, when he speaks,
The air, a charter&apos;d libertine, is still,
And the mute wonder lurketh in men&apos;s ears,
To steal his sweet and honey&apos;d sentences;
So that the art and practic part of life
Must be the mistress to this theoric:
Which is a wonder how his grace should glean it,
Since his addiction was to courses vain,
His companies unletter&apos;d, rude and shallow,
His hours fill&apos;d up with riots, banquets, sports,
And never noted in him any study,
Any retirement, any sequestration
From open haunts and popularity.</string>

My learned lord, we pray you to proceed
And justly and religiously unfold
Why the law Salique that they have in France
Or should, or should not, bar us in our claim:
And God forbid, my dear and faithful lord,
That you should fashion, wrest, or bow your reading,
Or nicely charge your understanding soul
With opening titles miscreate, whose right
Suits not in native colours with the truth;
For God doth know how many now in health
Shall drop their blood in approbation
Of what your reverence shall incite us to.
Therefore take heed how you impawn our person,
How you awake our sleeping sword of war:
We charge you, in the name of God, take heed;
For never two such kingdoms did contend
Without much fall of blood; whose guiltless drops
Are every one a woe, a sore complaint
&apos;Gainst him whose wrong gives edge unto the swords
That make such waste in brief mortality.
Under this conjuration, speak, my lord;
For we will hear, note and believe in heart
That what you speak is in your conscience wash&apos;d
As pure as sin with baptism.</string>

		<string>Then hear me, gracious sovereign, and you peers,
That owe yourselves, your lives and services
To this imperial throne. There is no bar
To make against your highness&apos; claim to France
But this, which they produce from Pharamond,
&apos;In terram Salicam mulieres ne succedant:&apos;
&apos;No woman shall succeed in Salique land:&apos;
Which Salique land the French unjustly gloze
To be the realm of France, and Pharamond
The founder of this law and female bar.
Yet their own authors faithfully affirm
That the land Salique is in Germany,
Between the floods of Sala and of Elbe;
Where Charles the Great, having subdued the Saxons,
There left behind and settled certain French;
Who, holding in disdain the German women
For some dishonest manners of their life,
Establish&apos;d then this law; to wit, no female
Should be inheritrix in Salique land:
Which Salique, as I said, &apos;twixt Elbe and Sala,
Is at this day in Germany call&apos;d Meisen.
Then doth it well appear that Salique law
Was not devised for the realm of France:
Nor did the French possess the Salique land
Until four hundred one and twenty years
After defunction of King Pharamond,
Idly supposed the founder of this law;
Who died within the year of our redemption
Four hundred twenty-six; and Charles the Great
Subdued the Saxons, and did seat the French
Beyond the river Sala, in the year
Eight hundred five. Besides, their writers say,
King Pepin, which deposed Childeric,
Did, as heir general, being descended
Of Blithild, which was daughter to King Clothair,
Make claim and title to the crown of France.
Hugh Capet also, who usurped the crown
Of Charles the duke of Lorraine, sole heir male
Of the true line and stock of Charles the Great,
To find his title with some shows of truth,
&apos;Through, in pure truth, it was corrupt and naught,
Convey&apos;d himself as heir to the Lady Lingare,
Daughter to Charlemain, who was the son
To Lewis the emperor, and Lewis the son
Of Charles the Great. Also King Lewis the Tenth,
Who was sole heir to the usurper Capet,
Could not keep quiet in his conscience,
Wearing the crown of France, till satisfied
That fair Queen Isabel, his grandmother,
Was lineal of the Lady Ermengare,
Daughter to Charles the foresaid duke of Lorraine:
By the which marriage the line of Charles the Great
Was re-united to the crown of France.
So that, as clear as is the summer&apos;s sun.
King Pepin&apos;s title and Hugh Capet&apos;s claim,
King Lewis his satisfaction, all appear
To hold in right and title of the female:
So do the kings of France unto this day;
Howbeit they would hold up this Salique law
To bar your highness claiming from the female,
And rather choose to hide them in a net
Than amply to imbar their crooked titles
Usurp&apos;d from you and your progenitors.</string>

		<string>Therefore doth heaven divide
The state of man in divers functions,
Setting endeavour in continual motion;
To which is fixed, as an aim or butt,
Obedience: for so work the honey-bees,
Creatures that by a rule in nature teach
The act of order to a peopled kingdom.
They have a king and officers of sorts;
Where some, like magistrates, correct at home,
Others, like merchants, venture trade abroad,
Others, like soldiers, armed in their stings,
Make boot upon the summer&apos;s velvet buds,
Which pillage they with merry march bring home
To the tent-royal of their emperor;
Who, busied in his majesty, surveys
The singing masons building roofs of gold,
The civil citizens kneading up the honey,
The poor mechanic porters crowding in
Their heavy burdens at his narrow gate,
The sad-eyed justice, with his surly hum,
Delivering o&apos;er to executors pale
The lazy yawning drone. I this infer,
That many things, having full reference
To one consent, may work contrariously:
As many arrows, loosed several ways,
Come to one mark; as many ways meet in one town;
As many fresh streams meet in one salt sea;
As many lines close in the dial&apos;s centre;
So may a thousand actions, once afoot.
End in one purpose, and be all well borne
Without defeat. Therefore to France, my liege.
Divide your happy England into four;
Whereof take you one quarter into France,
And you withal shall make all Gallia shake.
If we, with thrice such powers left at home,
Cannot defend our own doors from the dog,
Let us be worried and our nation lose
The name of hardiness and policy.</string>

His present and your pains we thank you for:
When we have march&apos;d our rackets to these balls,
We will, in France, by God&apos;s grace, play a set
Shall strike his father&apos;s crown into the hazard.
Tell him he hath made a match with such a wrangler
That all the courts of France will be disturb&apos;d
With chaces. And we understand him well,
How he comes o&apos;er us with our wilder days,
Not measuring what use we made of them.
We never valued this poor seat of England;
And therefore, living hence, did give ourself
To barbarous licence; as &apos;tis ever common
That men are merriest when they are from home.
But tell the Dauphin I will keep my state,
Be like a king and show my sail of greatness
When I do rouse me in my throne of France:
For that I have laid by my majesty
And plodded like a man for working-days,
But I will rise there with so full a glory
That I will dazzle all the eyes of France,
Yea, strike the Dauphin blind to look on us.
And tell the pleasant prince this mock of his
Hath turn&apos;d his balls to gun-stones; and his soul
Shall stand sore charged for the wasteful vengeance
That shall fly with them: for many a thousand widows
Shall this his mock mock out of their dear husbands;
Mock mothers from their sons, mock castles down;
And some are yet ungotten and unborn
That shall have cause to curse the Dauphin&apos;s scorn.
But this lies all within the will of God,
To whom I do appeal; and in whose name
Tell you the Dauphin I am coming on,
To venge me as I may and to put forth
My rightful hand in a well-hallow&apos;d cause.
So get you hence in peace; and tell the Dauphin
His jest will savour but of shallow wit,
When thousands weep more than did laugh at it.
Convey them with safe conduct. Fare you well.</string>

		<string>Now all the youth of England are on fire,
And silken dalliance in the wardrobe lies:
Now thrive the armourers, and honour&apos;s thought
Reigns solely in the breast of every man:
They sell the pasture now to buy the horse,
Following the mirror of all Christian kings,
With winged heels, as English Mercuries.
For now sits Expectation in the air,
And hides a sword from hilts unto the point
With crowns imperial, crowns and coronets,
Promised to Harry and his followers.
The French, advised by good intelligence
Of this most dreadful preparation,
Shake in their fear and with pale policy
Seek to divert the English purposes.
O England! model to thy inward greatness,
Like little body with a mighty heart,
What mightst thou do, that honour would thee do,
Were all thy children kind and natural!
But see thy fault! France hath in thee found out
A nest of hollow bosoms, which he fills
With treacherous crowns; and three corrupted men,
One, Richard Earl of Cambridge, and the second,
Henry Lord Scroop of Masham, and the third,
Sir Thomas Grey, knight, of Northumberland,
Have, for the gilt of France,--O guilt indeed!
Confirm&apos;d conspiracy with fearful France;
And by their hands this grace of kings must die,
If hell and treason hold their promises,
Ere he take ship for France, and in Southampton.
Linger your patience on; and we&apos;ll digest
The abuse of distance; force a play:
The sum is paid; the traitors are agreed;
The king is set from London; and the scene
Is now transported, gentles, to Southampton;
There is the playhouse now, there must you sit:
And thence to France shall we convey you safe,
And bring you back, charming the narrow seas
To give you gentle pass; for, if we may,
We&apos;ll not offend one stomach with our play.
But, till the king come forth, and not till then,
Unto Southampton do we shift our scene.</string>

		<string>The mercy that was quick in us but late,
By your own counsel is suppress&apos;d and kill&apos;d:
You must not dare, for shame, to talk of mercy;
For your own reasons turn into your bosoms,
As dogs upon their masters, worrying you.
See you, my princes, and my noble peers,
These English monsters! My Lord of Cambridge here,
You know how apt our love was to accord
To furnish him with all appertinents
Belonging to his honour; and this man
Hath, for a few light crowns, lightly conspired,
And sworn unto the practises of France,
To kill us here in Hampton: to the which
This knight, no less for bounty bound to us
Than Cambridge is, hath likewise sworn. But, O,
What shall I say to thee, Lord Scroop? thou cruel,
Ingrateful, savage and inhuman creature!
Thou that didst bear the key of all my counsels,
That knew&apos;st the very bottom of my soul,
That almost mightst have coin&apos;d me into gold,
Wouldst thou have practised on me for thy use,
May it be possible, that foreign hire
Could out of thee extract one spark of evil
That might annoy my finger? &apos;tis so strange,
That, though the truth of it stands off as gross
As black and white, my eye will scarcely see it.
Treason and murder ever kept together,
As two yoke-devils sworn to either&apos;s purpose,
Working so grossly in a natural cause,
That admiration did not whoop at them:
But thou, &apos;gainst all proportion, didst bring in
Wonder to wait on treason and on murder:
And whatsoever cunning fiend it was
That wrought upon thee so preposterously
Hath got the voice in hell for excellence:
All other devils that suggest by treasons
Do botch and bungle up damnation
With patches, colours, and with forms being fetch&apos;d
From glistering semblances of piety;
But he that temper&apos;d thee bade thee stand up,
Gave thee no instance why thou shouldst do treason,
Unless to dub thee with the name of traitor.
If that same demon that hath gull&apos;d thee thus
Should with his lion gait walk the whole world,
He might return to vasty Tartar back,
And tell the legions &apos;I can never win
A soul so easy as that Englishman&apos;s.&apos;
O, how hast thou with &apos;jealousy infected
The sweetness of affiance! Show men dutiful?
Why, so didst thou: seem they grave and learned?
Why, so didst thou: come they of noble family?
Why, so didst thou: seem they religious?
Why, so didst thou: or are they spare in diet,
Free from gross passion or of mirth or anger,
Constant in spirit, not swerving with the blood,
Garnish&apos;d and deck&apos;d in modest complement,
Not working with the eye without the ear,
And but in purged judgment trusting neither?
Such and so finely bolted didst thou seem:
And thus thy fall hath left a kind of blot,
To mark the full-fraught man and best indued
With some suspicion. I will weep for thee;
For this revolt of thine, methinks, is like
Another fall of man. Their faults are open:
Arrest them to the answer of the law;
And God acquit them of their practises!</string>

The venom clamours of a jealous woman
Poisons more deadly than a mad dog&apos;s tooth.
It seems his sleeps were hinder&apos;d by thy railing,
And therefore comes it that his head is light.
Thou say&apos;st his meat was sauced with thy upbraidings:
Unquiet meals make ill digestions;
Thereof the raging fire of fever bred;
And what&apos;s a fever but a fit of madness?
Thou say&apos;st his sports were hinderd by thy brawls:
Sweet recreation barr&apos;d, what doth ensue
But moody and dull melancholy,
Kinsman to grim and comfortless despair,
And at her heels a huge infectious troop
Of pale distemperatures and foes to life?
In food, in sport and life-preserving rest
To be disturb&apos;d, would mad or man or beast:
The consequence is then thy jealous fits
Have scared thy husband from the use of wits.</string>

		<string>God quit you in his mercy! Hear your sentence.
You have conspired against our royal person,
Join&apos;d with an enemy proclaim&apos;d and from his coffers
Received the golden earnest of our death;
Wherein you would have sold your king to slaughter,
His princes and his peers to servitude,
His subjects to oppression and contempt
And his whole kingdom into desolation.
Touching our person seek we no revenge;
But we our kingdom&apos;s safety must so tender,
Whose ruin you have sought, that to her laws
We do deliver you. Get you therefore hence,
Poor miserable wretches, to your death:
The taste whereof, God of his mercy give
You patience to endure, and true repentance
Of all your dear offences! Bear them hence.

[Exeunt CAMBRIDGE, SCROOP and GREY, guarded]

Now, lords, for France; the enterprise whereof
Shall be to you, as us, like glorious.
We doubt not of a fair and lucky war,
Since God so graciously hath brought to light
This dangerous treason lurking in our way
To hinder our beginnings. We doubt not now
But every rub is smoothed on our way.
Then forth, dear countrymen: let us deliver
Our puissance into the hand of God,
Putting it straight in expedition.
Cheerly to sea; the signs of war advance:
No king of England, if not king of France.</string>

He wills you, in the name of God Almighty,
That you divest yourself, and lay apart
The borrow&apos;d glories that by gift of heaven,
By law of nature and of nations, &apos;long
To him and to his heirs; namely, the crown
And all wide-stretched honours that pertain
By custom and the ordinance of times
Unto the crown of France. That you may know
&apos;Tis no sinister nor no awkward claim,
Pick&apos;d from the worm-holes of long-vanish&apos;d days,
Nor from the dust of old oblivion raked,
He sends you this most memorable line,
In every branch truly demonstrative;
Willing to overlook this pedigree:
And when you find him evenly derived
From his most famed of famous ancestors,
Edward the Third, he bids you then resign
Your crown and kingdom, indirectly held
From him the native and true challenger.

[Or else what follows?]

Bloody constraint; for if you hide the crown
Even in your hearts, there will he rake for it:
Therefore in fierce tempest is he coming,
In thunder and in earthquake, like a Jove,
That, if requiring fail, he will compel;
And bids you, in the bowels of the Lord,
Deliver up the crown, and to take mercy
On the poor souls for whom this hungry war
Opens his vasty jaws; and on your head
Turning the widows&apos; tears, the orphans&apos; cries
The dead men&apos;s blood, the pining maidens groans,
For husbands, fathers and betrothed lovers,
That shall be swallow&apos;d in this controversy.
This is his claim, his threatening and my message...</string>

In motion of no less celerity
Than that of thought. Suppose that you have seen
The well-appointed king at Hampton pier
Embark his royalty; and his brave fleet
With silken streamers the young Phoebus fanning:
Play with your fancies, and in them behold
Upon the hempen tackle ship-boys climbing;
Hear the shrill whistle which doth order give
To sounds confused; behold the threaden sails,
Borne with the invisible and creeping wind,
Draw the huge bottoms through the furrow&apos;d sea,
Breasting the lofty surge: O, do but think
You stand upon the ravage and behold
A city on the inconstant billows dancing;
For so appears this fleet majestical,
Holding due course to Harfleur. Follow, follow:
Grapple your minds to sternage of this navy,
And leave your England, as dead midnight still,
Guarded with grandsires, babies and old women,
Either past or not arrived to pith and puissance;
For who is he, whose chin is but enrich&apos;d
With one appearing hair, that will not follow
These cull&apos;d and choice-drawn cavaliers to France?
Work, work your thoughts, and therein see a siege;
Behold the ordnance on their carriages,
With fatal mouths gaping on girded Harfleur.
Suppose the ambassador from the French comes back;
Tells Harry that the king doth offer him
Katharine his daughter, and with her, to dowry,
Some petty and unprofitable dukedoms.
The offer likes not: and the nimble gunner
With linstock now the devilish cannon touches,
And down goes all before them. Still be kind,
And eke out our performance with your mind.</string>

As modest stillness and humility:

Hold hard the breath and bend up every spirit
To his full height. On, on, you noblest English.
Whose blood is fet from fathers of war-proof!
Fathers that, like so many Alexanders,
Have in these parts from morn till even fought
And sheathed their swords for lack of argument:
Dishonour not your mothers; now attest
That those whom you call&apos;d fathers did beget you.
Be copy now to men of grosser blood,
And teach them how to war. And you, good yeoman,
Whose limbs were made in England, show us here
The mettle of your pasture; let us swear
That you are worth your breeding; which I doubt not;
For there is none of you so mean and base,
That hath not noble lustre in your eyes.
I see you stand like greyhounds in the slips,
Straining upon the start. The game&apos;s afoot:
Follow your spirit, and upon this charge
Cry &apos;God for Harry, England, and Saint George!&apos;</string>

		<string>As young as I am, I have observed these three
swashers. I am boy to them all three: but all they
three, though they would serve me, could not be man
to me; for indeed three such antics do not amount to
a man. For Bardolph, he is white-livered and
red-faced; by the means whereof a&apos; faces it out, but
fights not. For Pistol, he hath a killing tongue
and a quiet sword; by the means whereof a&apos; breaks
words, and keeps whole weapons. For Nym, he hath
heard that men of few words are the best men; and
therefore he scorns to say his prayers, lest a&apos;
should be thought a coward: but his few bad words
are matched with as few good deeds; for a&apos; never
broke any man&apos;s head but his own, and that was
against a post when he was drunk. They will steal
any thing, and call it purchase. Bardolph stole a
lute-case, bore it twelve leagues, and sold it for
three half pence. Nym and Bardolph are sworn
brothers in filching, and in Calais they stole a
fire-shovel: I knew by that piece of service the
men would carry coals. They would have me as
familiar with men&apos;s pockets as their gloves or their
handkerchers: which makes much against my manhood,
if I should take from another&apos;s pocket to put into
mine; for it is plain pocketing up of wrongs. I
must leave them, and seek some better service:
their villany goes against my weak stomach, and
therefore I must cast it up.</string>

This is the latest parle we will admit;
Therefore to our best mercy give yourselves;
Or like to men proud of destruction
Defy us to our worst: for, as I am a soldier,
A name that in my thoughts becomes me best,
If I begin the battery once again,
I will not leave the half-achieved Harfleur
Till in her ashes she lie buried.
The gates of mercy shall be all shut up,
And the flesh&apos;d soldier, rough and hard of heart,
In liberty of bloody hand shall range
With conscience wide as hell, mowing like grass
Your fresh-fair virgins and your flowering infants.
What is it then to me, if impious war,
Array&apos;d in flames like to the prince of fiends,
Do, with his smirch&apos;d complexion, all fell feats
Enlink&apos;d to waste and desolation?
What is&apos;t to me, when you yourselves are cause,
If your pure maidens fall into the hand
Of hot and forcing violation?
What rein can hold licentious wickedness
When down the hill he holds his fierce career?
We may as bootless spend our vain command
Upon the enraged soldiers in their spoil
As send precepts to the leviathan
To come ashore. Therefore, you men of Harfleur,
Take pity of your town and of your people,
Whiles yet my soldiers are in my command;
Whiles yet the cool and temperate wind of grace
O&apos;erblows the filthy and contagious clouds
Of heady murder, spoil and villany.
If not, why, in a moment look to see
The blind and bloody soldier with foul hand
Defile the locks of your shrill-shrieking daughters;
Your fathers taken by the silver beards,
And their most reverend heads dash&apos;d to the walls,
Your naked infants spitted upon pikes,
Whiles the mad mothers with their howls confused
Do break the clouds, as did the wives of Jewry
At Herod&apos;s bloody-hunting slaughtermen.
What say you? will you yield, and this avoid,
Or, guilty in defence, be thus destroy&apos;d?</string>

thought not good to bruise an injury till it were
full ripe: now we speak upon our cue, and our voice

his weakness, and admire our sufferance. Bid him
therefore consider of his ransom; which must
proportion the losses we have borne, the subjects we
have lost, the disgrace we have digested; which in
weight to re-answer, his pettiness would bow under.
For our losses, his exchequer is too poor; for the
effusion of our blood, the muster of his kingdom too
faint a number; and for our disgrace, his own
person, kneeling at our feet, but a weak and
worthless satisfaction. To this add defiance: and

Where great additions swell&apos;s, and virtue none,
It is a dropsied honour. Good alone

The property by what it is should go,
Not by the title. She is young, wise, fair;
In these to nature she&apos;s immediate heir,
And these breed honour: that is honour&apos;s scorn,
Which challenges itself as honour&apos;s born
And is not like the sire: honours thrive,
When rather from our acts we them derive
Than our foregoers: the mere word&apos;s a slave
Debosh&apos;d on every tomb, on every grave
A lying trophy, and as oft is dumb

Of honour&apos;d bones indeed. What should be said?

		<string>My liege, I am advised what I say,
Neither disturbed with the effect of wine,
Nor heady-rash, provoked with raging ire,
Albeit my wrongs might make one wiser mad.
This woman lock&apos;d me out this day from dinner:
That goldsmith there, were he not pack&apos;d with her,
Could witness it, for he was with me then;
Who parted with me to go fetch a chain,
Promising to bring it to the Porpentine,
Where Balthazar and I did dine together.
Our dinner done, and he not coming thither,
I went to seek him: in the street I met him
And in his company that gentleman.
There did this perjured goldsmith swear me down
That I this day of him received the chain,
Which, God he knows, I saw not: for the which
He did arrest me with an officer.
I did obey, and sent my peasant home
For certain ducats: he with none return&apos;d
Then fairly I bespoke the officer
To go in person with me to my house.
By the way we met
My wife, her sister, and a rabble more
Of vile confederates. Along with them
They brought one Pinch, a hungry lean-faced villain,
A mere anatomy, a mountebank,
A threadbare juggler and a fortune-teller,
A needy, hollow-eyed, sharp-looking wretch,
A dead-looking man: this pernicious slave,
Forsooth, took on him as a conjurer,
And, gazing in mine eyes, feeling my pulse,
And with no face, as &apos;twere, outfacing me,
Cries out, I was possess&apos;d. Then all together
They fell upon me, bound me, bore me thence
And in a dark and dankish vault at home
There left me and my man, both bound together;
Till, gnawing with my teeth my bonds in sunder,
I gain&apos;d my freedom, and immediately
Ran hither to your grace; whom I beseech
To give me ample satisfaction
For these deep shames and great indignities.</string>

		<string>Thou dost thy office fairly. Turn thee back.
And tell thy king I do not seek him now;
But could be willing to march on to Calais
Without impeachment: for, to say the sooth,
Though &apos;tis no wisdom to confess so much
Unto an enemy of craft and vantage,
My people are with sickness much enfeebled,
My numbers lessened, and those few I have
Almost no better than so many French;
Who when they were in health, I tell thee, herald,
I thought upon one pair of English legs
Did march three Frenchmen. Yet, forgive me, God,
That I do brag thus! This your air of France
Hath blown that vice in me: I must repent.
Go therefore, tell thy master here I am;
My ransom is this frail and worthless trunk,
My army but a weak and sickly guard;
Yet, God before, tell him we will come on,
Though France himself and such another neighbour
Stand in our way. There&apos;s for thy labour, Montjoy.
Go bid thy master well advise himself:
If we may pass, we will; if we be hinder&apos;d,
We shall your tawny ground with your red blood
Discolour: and so Montjoy, fare you well.
The sum of all our answer is but this:
We would not seek a battle, as we are;
Nor, as we are, we say we will not shun it:
So tell your master.</string>

		<string>Now entertain conjecture of a time
When creeping murmur and the poring dark
Fills the wide vessel of the universe.
From camp to camp through the foul womb of night
The hum of either army stilly sounds,
That the fixed sentinels almost receive
The secret whispers of each other&apos;s watch:
Fire answers fire, and through their paly flames
Each battle sees the other&apos;s umber&apos;d face;
Steed threatens steed, in high and boastful neighs
Piercing the night&apos;s dull ear, and from the tents
The armourers, accomplishing the knights,
With busy hammers closing rivets up,
Give dreadful note of preparation:
The country cocks do crow, the clocks do toll,
And the third hour of drowsy morning name.
Proud of their numbers and secure in soul,
The confident and over-lusty French
Do the low-rated English play at dice;
And chide the cripple tardy-gaited night
Who, like a foul and ugly witch, doth limp
So tediously away. The poor condemned English,
Like sacrifices, by their watchful fires
Sit patiently and inly ruminate
The morning&apos;s danger, and their gesture sad
Investing lank-lean; cheeks and war-worn coats
Presenteth them unto the gazing moon
So many horrid ghosts. O now, who will behold
The royal captain of this ruin&apos;d band
Walking from watch to watch, from tent to tent,
Let him cry &apos;Praise and glory on his head!&apos;
For forth he goes and visits all his host.
Bids them good morrow with a modest smile
And calls them brothers, friends and countrymen.
Upon his royal face there is no note
How dread an army hath enrounded him;
Nor doth he dedicate one jot of colour
Unto the weary and all-watched night,
But freshly looks and over-bears attaint
With cheerful semblance and sweet majesty;
That every wretch, pining and pale before,
Beholding him, plucks comfort from his looks:
A largess universal like the sun
His liberal eye doth give to every one,
Thawing cold fear, that mean and gentle all,
Behold, as may unworthiness define,
A little touch of Harry in the night.
And so our scene must to the battle fly;
Where--O for pity!--we shall much disgrace
With four or five most vile and ragged foils,
Right ill-disposed in brawl ridiculous,
The name of Agincourt. Yet sit and see,
Minding true things by what their mockeries be.</string>

		<string>So, if a son that is by his father sent about
merchandise do sinfully miscarry upon the sea, the
imputation of his wickedness by your rule, should be
imposed upon his father that sent him: or if a
servant, under his master&apos;s command transporting a
sum of money, be assailed by robbers and die in
many irreconciled iniquities, you may call the
business of the master the author of the servant&apos;s
damnation: but this is not so: the king is not
bound to answer the particular endings of his
soldiers, the father of his son, nor the master of
his servant; for they purpose not their death, when
they purpose their services. Besides, there is no
king, be his cause never so spotless, if it come to
the arbitrement of swords, can try it out with all
unspotted soldiers: some peradventure have on them
the guilt of premeditated and contrived murder;
some, of beguiling virgins with the broken seals of
perjury; some, making the wars their bulwark, that
have before gored the gentle bosom of peace with
pillage and robbery. Now, if these men have
defeated the law and outrun native punishment,
though they can outstrip men, they have no wings to
fly from God: war is his beadle, war is vengeance;
so that here men are punished for before-breach of
the king&apos;s laws in now the king&apos;s quarrel: where
they feared the death, they have borne life away;
and where they would be safe, they perish: then if
they die unprovided, no more is the king guilty of
their damnation than he was before guilty of those
impieties for the which they are now visited. Every
subject&apos;s duty is the king&apos;s; but every subject&apos;s
soul is his own. Therefore should every soldier in
the wars do as every sick man in his bed, wash every
mote out of his conscience: and dying so, death
is to him advantage; or not dying, the time was
blessedly lost wherein such preparation was gained:
and in him that escapes, it were not sin to think
that, making God so free an offer, He let him
outlive that day to see His greatness and to teach
others how they should prepare.</string>

		<string>Upon the king! let us our lives, our souls,
Our debts, our careful wives,
Our children and our sins lay on the king!
We must bear all. O hard condition,
Twin-born with greatness, subject to the breath
Of every fool, whose sense no more can feel
But his own wringing! What infinite heart&apos;s-ease
Must kings neglect, that private men enjoy!
And what have kings, that privates have not too,
Save ceremony, save general ceremony?
And what art thou, thou idle ceremony?
What kind of god art thou, that suffer&apos;st more
Of mortal griefs than do thy worshippers?
What are thy rents? what are thy comings in?
O ceremony, show me but thy worth!
What is thy soul of adoration?
Art thou aught else but place, degree and form,
Creating awe and fear in other men?
Wherein thou art less happy being fear&apos;d
Than they in fearing.
What drink&apos;st thou oft, instead of homage sweet,
But poison&apos;d flattery? O, be sick, great greatness,
And bid thy ceremony give thee cure!
Think&apos;st thou the fiery fever will go out
With titles blown from adulation?
Will it give place to flexure and low bending?
Canst thou, when thou command&apos;st the beggar&apos;s knee,
Command the health of it? No, thou proud dream,
That play&apos;st so subtly with a king&apos;s repose;
I am a king that find thee, and I know
&apos;Tis not the balm, the sceptre and the ball,
The sword, the mace, the crown imperial,
The intertissued robe of gold and pearl,
The farced title running &apos;fore the king,
The throne he sits on, nor the tide of pomp
That beats upon the high shore of this world,
No, not all these, thrice-gorgeous ceremony,
Not all these, laid in bed majestical,
Can sleep so soundly as the wretched slave,
Who with a body fill&apos;d and vacant mind
Gets him to rest, cramm&apos;d with distressful bread;
Never sees horrid night, the child of hell,
But, like a lackey, from the rise to set
Sweats in the eye of Phoebus and all night
Sleeps in Elysium; next day after dawn,
Doth rise and help Hyperion to his horse,
And follows so the ever-running year,
With profitable labour, to his grave:
And, but for ceremony, such a wretch,
Winding up days with toil and nights with sleep,
Had the fore-hand and vantage of a king.
The slave, a member of the country&apos;s peace,
Enjoys it; but in gross brain little wots
What watch the king keeps to maintain the peace,
Whose hours the peasant best advantages.</string>

Pluck their hearts from them. Not to-day, O Lord,
O, not to-day, think not upon the fault
My father made in compassing the crown!
I Richard&apos;s body have interred anew;
And on it have bestow&apos;d more contrite tears
Than from it issued forced drops of blood:
Five hundred poor I have in yearly pay,
Who twice a-day their wither&apos;d hands hold up
Toward heaven, to pardon blood; and I have built
Two chantries, where the sad and solemn priests
Sing still for Richard&apos;s soul. More will I do;
Though all that I can do is nothing worth,
Since that my penitence comes after all,
Imploring pardon.</string>

And all is done. Then let the trumpets sound

For our approach shall so much dare the field

Lob down their heads, dropping the hides and hips,
The gum down-roping from their pale-dead eyes
And in their pale dull mouths the gimmal bit
Lies foul with chew&apos;d grass, still and motionless;
And their executors, the knavish crows,
Fly o&apos;er them, all impatient for their hour.
Description cannot suit itself in words
To demonstrate the life of such a battle
In life so lifeless as it shows itself.</string>

But one ten thousand of those men in England
That do no work to-day!]

What&apos;s he that wishes so?
My cousin Westmoreland? No, my fair cousin:
If we are mark&apos;d to die, we are enow
To do our country loss; and if to live,
The fewer men, the greater share of honour.
God&apos;s will! I pray thee, wish not one man more.
By Jove, I am not covetous for gold,
Nor care I who doth feed upon my cost;
It yearns me not if men my garments wear;
Such outward things dwell not in my desires:
But if it be a sin to covet honour,
I am the most offending soul alive.
No, faith, my coz, wish not a man from England:
God&apos;s peace! I would not lose so great an honour
As one man more, methinks, would share from me
For the best hope I have. O, do not wish one more!
Rather proclaim it, Westmoreland, through my host,
That he which hath no stomach to this fight,
Let him depart; his passport shall be made
And crowns for convoy put into his purse:
We would not die in that man&apos;s company
That fears his fellowship to die with us.
This day is called the feast of Crispian:
He that outlives this day, and comes safe home,
Will stand a tip-toe when the day is named,
And rouse him at the name of Crispian.
He that shall live this day, and see old age,
Will yearly on the vigil feast his neighbours,
And say &apos;To-morrow is Saint Crispian:&apos;
Then will he strip his sleeve and show his scars.
And say &apos;These wounds I had on Crispin&apos;s day.&apos;
Old men forget: yet all shall be forgot,
But he&apos;ll remember with advantages
What feats he did that day: then shall our names.
Familiar in his mouth as household words
Harry the king, Bedford and Exeter,
Warwick and Talbot, Salisbury and Gloucester,
Be in their flowing cups freshly remember&apos;d.
This story shall the good man teach his son;
And Crispin Crispian shall ne&apos;er go by,
From this day to the ending of the world,
But we in it shall be remember&apos;d;
We few, we happy few, we band of brothers;
For he to-day that sheds his blood with me
Shall be my brother; be he ne&apos;er so vile,
This day shall gentle his condition:
And gentlemen in England now a-bed
Shall think themselves accursed they were not here,
And hold their manhoods cheap whiles any speaks
That fought with us upon Saint Crispin&apos;s day.</string>

Bid them achieve me and then sell my bones.
Good God! why should they mock poor fellows thus?
The man that once did sell the lion&apos;s skin
While the beast lived, was killed with hunting him.
A many of our bodies shall no doubt
Find native graves; upon the which, I trust,
Shall witness live in brass of this day&apos;s work:
And those that leave their valiant bones in France,
Dying like men, though buried in your dunghills,
They shall be famed; for there the sun shall greet them,
And draw their honours reeking up to heaven;
Leaving their earthly parts to choke your clime,
The smell whereof shall breed a plague in France.
Mark then abounding valour in our English,
That being dead, like to the bullet&apos;s grazing,
Break out into a second course of mischief,
Killing in relapse of mortality.
Let me speak proudly: tell the constable
We are but warriors for the working-day;
Our gayness and our gilt are all besmirch&apos;d
With rainy marching in the painful field;
There&apos;s not a piece of feather in our host--
Good argument, I hope, we will not fly--
And time hath worn us into slovenry:
But, by the mass, our hearts are in the trim;
And my poor soldiers tell me, yet ere night
They&apos;ll be in fresher robes, or they will pluck
The gay new coats o&apos;er the French soldiers&apos; heads
And turn them out of service. If they do this,--
As, if God please, they shall,--my ransom then
Will soon be levied. Herald, save thou thy labour;
Come thou no more for ransom, gentle herald:
They shall have none, I swear, but these my joints;
Which if they have as I will leave &apos;em them,
Shall yield them little, tell the constable.</string>

		<string>In which array, brave soldier, doth he lie,
Larding the plain; and by his bloody side,
Yoke-fellow to his honour-owing wounds,
The noble Earl of Suffolk also lies.
Suffolk first died: and York, all haggled over,
Comes to him, where in gore he lay insteep&apos;d,
And takes him by the beard; kisses the gashes
That bloodily did spawn upon his face;
And cries aloud &apos;Tarry, dear cousin Suffolk!
My soul shall thine keep company to heaven;
Tarry, sweet soul, for mine, then fly abreast,
As in this glorious and well-foughten field
We kept together in our chivalry!&apos;
Upon these words I came and cheer&apos;d him up:
He smiled me in the face, raught me his hand,
And, with a feeble gripe, says &apos;Dear my lord,
Commend my service to me sovereign.&apos;
So did he turn and over Suffolk&apos;s neck
He threw his wounded arm and kiss&apos;d his lips;
And so espoused to death, with blood he seal&apos;d
A testament of noble-ending love.
The pretty and sweet manner of it forced
Those waters from me which I would have stopp&apos;d;
But I had not so much of man in me,
And all my mother came into mine eyes
And gave me up to tears.</string>

		<string>This note doth tell me of ten thousand French
That in the field lie slain: of princes, in this number,
And nobles bearing banners, there lie dead
One hundred twenty six: added to these,
Of knights, esquires, and gallant gentlemen,
Eight thousand and four hundred; of the which,
Five hundred were but yesterday dubb&apos;d knights:
So that, in these ten thousand they have lost,
There are but sixteen hundred mercenaries;
The rest are princes, barons, lords, knights, squires,
And gentlemen of blood and quality.
The names of those their nobles that lie dead:
Charles Delabreth, high constable of France;
Jaques of Chatillon, admiral of France;
The master of the cross-bows, Lord Rambures;
Great Master of France, the brave Sir Guichard Dolphin,
John Duke of Alencon, Anthony Duke of Brabant,
The brother of the Duke of Burgundy,
And Edward Duke of Bar: of lusty earls,
Grandpre and Roussi, Fauconberg and Foix,
Beaumont and Marle, Vaudemont and Lestrale.
Here was a royal fellowship of death!
Where is the number of our English dead?

[Herald shews him another paper]

Edward the Duke of York, the Earl of Suffolk,
Sir Richard Ketly, Davy Gam, esquire:
None else of name; and of all other men
But five and twenty. O God, thy arm was here;
And not to us, but to thy arm alone,
Ascribe we all! When, without stratagem,
But in plain shock and even play of battle,
Was ever known so great and little loss
On one part and on the other? Take it, God,
For it is none but thine!</string>

		<string>Vouchsafe to those that have not read the story,
That I may prompt them: and of such as have,
I humbly pray them to admit the excuse
Of time, of numbers and due course of things,
Which cannot in their huge and proper life
Be here presented. Now we bear the king
Toward Calais: grant him there; there seen,
Heave him away upon your winged thoughts
Athwart the sea. Behold, the English beach
Pales in the flood with men, with wives and boys,
Whose shouts and claps out-voice the deep mouth&apos;d sea,
Which like a mighty whiffler &apos;fore the king
Seems to prepare his way: so let him land,
And solemnly see him set on to London.
So swift a pace hath thought that even now
You may imagine him upon Blackheath;
Where that his lords desire him to have borne
His bruised helmet and his bended sword
Before him through the city: he forbids it,
Being free from vainness and self-glorious pride;
Giving full trophy, signal and ostent
Quite from himself to God. But now behold,
In the quick forge and working-house of thought,
How London doth pour out her citizens!
The mayor and all his brethren in best sort,
Like to the senators of the antique Rome,
With the plebeians swarming at their heels,
Go forth and fetch their conquering Caesar in:
As, by a lower but loving likelihood,
Were now the general of our gracious empress,
As in good time he may, from Ireland coming,
Bringing rebellion broached on his sword,
How many would the peaceful city quit,
To welcome him! much more, and much more cause,
Did they this Harry. Now in London place him;
As yet the lamentation of the French
Invites the King of England&apos;s stay at home;
The emperor&apos;s coming in behalf of France,
To order peace between them; and omit
All the occurrences, whatever chanced,
Till Harry&apos;s back-return again to France:
There must we bring him; and myself have play&apos;d
The interim, by remembering you &apos;tis past.
Then brook abridgment, and your eyes advance,
After your thoughts, straight back again to France.</string>

		<string>My duty to you both, on equal love,
Great Kings of France and England! That I have labour&apos;d,
With all my wits, my pains and strong endeavours,
To bring your most imperial majesties
Unto this bar and royal interview,
Your mightiness on both parts best can witness.
Since then my office hath so far prevail&apos;d
That, face to face and royal eye to eye,
You have congreeted, let it not disgrace me,
If I demand, before this royal view,
What rub or what impediment there is,
Why that the naked, poor and mangled Peace,
Dear nurse of arts and joyful births,
Should not in this best garden of the world
Our fertile France, put up her lovely visage?
Alas, she hath from France too long been chased,
And all her husbandry doth lie on heaps,
Corrupting in its own fertility.
Her vine, the merry cheerer of the heart,
Unpruned dies; her hedges even-pleach&apos;d,
Like prisoners wildly overgrown with hair,
Put forth disorder&apos;d twigs; her fallow leas
The darnel, hemlock and rank fumitory
Doth root upon, while that the coulter rusts
That should deracinate such savagery;
The even mead, that erst brought sweetly forth
The freckled cowslip, burnet and green clover,
Wanting the scythe, all uncorrected, rank,
Conceives by idleness and nothing teems
But hateful docks, rough thistles, kecksies, burs,
Losing both beauty and utility.
And as our vineyards, fallows, meads and hedges,
Defective in their natures, grow to wildness,
Even so our houses and ourselves and children
Have lost, or do not learn for want of time,
The sciences that should become our country;
But grow like savages,--as soldiers will
That nothing do but meditate on blood,--
To swearing and stern looks, diffused attire
And every thing that seems unnatural.
Which to reduce into our former favour
You are assembled: and my speech entreats
That I may know the let, why gentle Peace
Should not expel these inconveniences
And bless us with her former qualities.</string>

		<string>Marry, if you would put me to verses or to dance for
your sake, Kate, why you undid me: for the one, I
have neither words nor measure, and for the other, I
have no strength in measure, yet a reasonable
measure in strength. If I could win a lady at
leap-frog, or by vaulting into my saddle with my
armour on my back, under the correction of bragging
be it spoken. I should quickly leap into a wife.
Or if I might buffet for my love, or bound my horse
for her favours, I could lay on like a butcher and
sit like a jack-an-apes, never off. But, before God,
Kate, I cannot look greenly nor gasp out my
eloquence, nor I have no cunning in protestation;
only downright oaths, which I never use till urged,
nor never break for urging. If thou canst love a
fellow of this temper, Kate, whose face is not worth
sun-burning, that never looks in his glass for love
of any thing he sees there, let thine eye be thy
cook. I speak to thee plain soldier: If thou canst
love me for this, take me: if not, to say to thee
that I shall die, is true; but for thy love, by the
Lord, no; yet I love thee too. And while thou
livest, dear Kate, take a fellow of plain and
uncoined constancy; for he perforce must do thee
right, because he hath not the gift to woo in other
places: for these fellows of infinite tongue, that
can rhyme themselves into ladies&apos; favours, they do
always reason themselves out again. What! a
speaker is but a prater; a rhyme is but a ballad. A
good leg will fall; a straight back will stoop; a
black beard will turn white; a curled pate will grow
bald; a fair face will wither; a full eye will wax
hollow: but a good heart, Kate, is the sun and the
moon; or, rather, the sun, and not the moon; for it
shines bright and never changes, but keeps his
course truly. If thou would have such a one, take
me; and take me, take a soldier; take a soldier,
take a king. And what sayest thou then to my love?
speak, my fair, and fairly, I pray thee.</string>

my father&apos;s ambition! he was thinking of civil wars
when he got me: therefore was I created with a
stubborn outside, with an aspect of iron, that, when
I come to woo ladies, I fright them. But, in faith,
Kate, the elder I wax, the better I shall appear:
my comfort is, that old age, that ill layer up of
beauty, can do no more, spoil upon my face: thou
hast me, if thou hast me, at the worst; and thou
shalt wear me, if thou wear me, better and better:
and therefore tell me, most fair Katharine, will you
have me? Put off your maiden blushes; avouch the
thoughts of your heart with the looks of an empress;
take me by the hand, and say &apos;Harry of England I am
thine:&apos; which word thou shalt no sooner bless mine
ear withal, but I will tell thee aloud &apos;England is
thine, Ireland is thine, France is thine, and Harry
Plantagenet is thine;&apos; who though I speak it before
his face, if he be not fellow with the best king,
thou shalt find the best king of good fellows.
Come, your answer in broken music; for thy voice is
music and thy English broken; therefore, queen of
all, Katharine, break thy mind to me in broken
English; wilt thou have me?</string>

		<string>O, no; wherein Lord Talbot was o&apos;erthrown:
The circumstance I&apos;ll tell you more at large.
The tenth of August last this dreadful lord,
Retiring from the siege of Orleans,
Having full scarce six thousand in his troop.
By three and twenty thousand of the French
Was round encompassed and set upon.
No leisure had he to enrank his men;
He wanted pikes to set before his archers;
Instead whereof sharp stakes pluck&apos;d out of hedges
They pitched in the ground confusedly,
To keep the horsemen off from breaking in.
More than three hours the fight continued;
Where valiant Talbot above human thought
Enacted wonders with his sword and lance:
Hundreds he sent to hell, and none durst stand him;
Here, there, and every where, enraged he flew:
The French exclaim&apos;d, the devil was in arms;
All the whole army stood agazed on him:
His soldiers spying his undaunted spirit
A Talbot! a Talbot! cried out amain
And rush&apos;d into the bowels of the battle.
Here had the conquest fully been seal&apos;d up,
If Sir John Fastolfe had not play&apos;d the coward:
He, being in the vaward, placed behind
With purpose to relieve and follow them,
Cowardly fled, not having struck one stroke.
Hence grew the general wreck and massacre;
Enclosed were they with their enemies:
A base Walloon, to win the Dauphin&apos;s grace,
Thrust Talbot with a spear into the back,
Whom all France with their chief assembled strength
Durst not presume to look once in the face.</string>

But, O! the treacherous Fastolfe wounds my heart,
Whom with my bare fists I would execute,
If I now had him brought into my power.

With scoffs and scorns and contumelious taunts.
In open market-place produced they me,
To be a public spectacle to all:
Here, said they, is the terror of the French,
The scarecrow that affrights our children so.
Then broke I from the officers that led me,
And with my nails digg&apos;d stones out of the ground,
To hurl at the beholders of my shame:
My grisly countenance made others fly;
None durst come near for fear of sudden death.
In iron walls they deem&apos;d me not secure;
So great fear of my name &apos;mongst them was spread,
That they supposed I could rend bars of steel,
And spurn in pieces posts of adamant:
Wherefore a guard of chosen shot I had,
That walked about me every minute-while;
And if I did but stir out of my bed,
Ready they were to shoot me to the heart.</string>

So long attended thee. If thou wert honourable,
Thou wouldst have told this tale for virtue, not
For such an end thou seek&apos;st,--as base as strange.
Thou wrong&apos;st a gentleman, who is as far
From thy report as thou from honour, and
Solicit&apos;st here a lady that disdains
Thee and the devil alike. What ho, Pisanio!
The king my father shall be made acquainted
Of thy assault: if he shall think it fit,
A saucy stranger in his court to mart
As in a Romish stew and to expound
His beastly mind to us, he hath a court
He little cares for and a daughter who
He not respects at all. What, ho, Pisanio!</string>

One eye thou hast, to look to heaven for grace:
The sun with one eye vieweth all the world.
Heaven, be thou gracious to none alive,
If Salisbury wants mercy at thy hands!
Bear hence his body; I will help to bury it.
Sir Thomas Gargrave, hast thou any life?
Speak unto Talbot; nay, look up to him.
Salisbury, cheer thy spirit with this comfort;
Thou shalt not die whiles--

For every drop of blood was drawn from him,
There hath at least five Frenchmen died tonight.
And that hereafter ages may behold
What ruin happen&apos;d in revenge of him,
Within their chiefest temple I&apos;ll erect
A tomb, wherein his corpse shall be interr&apos;d:
Upon the which, that every one may read,
Shall be engraved the sack of Orleans,
The treacherous manner of his mournful death
And what a terror he had been to France.
But, lords, in all our bloody massacre,
I muse we met not with the Dauphin&apos;s grace,
His new-come champion, virtuous Joan of Arc,
Nor any of his false confederates.

[&apos;Tis thought, Lord Talbot, when the fight began,
Roused on the sudden from their drowsy beds,
They did amongst the troops of armed men
Leap o&apos;er the walls for refuge in the field.]

Myself, as far as I could well discern
For smoke and dusky vapours of the night,
Am sure I scared the Dauphin and his trull,
When arm in arm they both came swiftly running,
Like to a pair of loving turtle-doves
That could not live asunder day or night.
After that things are set in order here,
We&apos;ll follow them with all the power we have.</string>

Let dying Mortimer here rest himself.
Even like a man new haled from the rack,
So fare my limbs with long imprisonment.
And these grey locks, the pursuivants of death,
Nestor-like aged in an age of care,
Argue the end of Edmund Mortimer.
These eyes, like lamps whose wasting oil is spent,
Wax dim, as drawing to their exigent;
Weak shoulders, overborne with burthening grief,
And pithless arms, like to a wither&apos;d vine
That droops his sapless branches to the ground;
Yet are these feet, whose strengthless stay is numb,
Unable to support this lump of clay,
Swift-winged with desire to get a grave,
As witting I no other comfort have.
But tell me, keeper, will my nephew come?

[Richard Plantagenet, my lord, will come:
We sent unto the Temple, unto his chamber;
And answer was return&apos;d that he will come.]

Enough: my soul shall then be satisfied.
Poor gentleman! his wrong doth equal mine.
Since Henry Monmouth first began to reign,
Before whose glory I was great in arms,
This loathsome sequestration have I had:
And even since then hath Richard been obscured,
Deprived of honour and inheritance.
But now the arbitrator of despairs,
Just death, kind umpire of men&apos;s miseries,
With sweet enlargement doth dismiss me hence:
I would his troubles likewise were expired,
That so he might recover what was lost.</string>

And death approach not ere my tale be done.
Henry the Fourth, grandfather to this king,
Deposed his nephew Richard, Edward&apos;s son,
The first-begotten and the lawful heir,
Of Edward king, the third of that descent:
During whose reign the Percies of the north,
Finding his usurpation most unjust,
Endeavor&apos;d my advancement to the throne:
The reason moved these warlike lords to this
Was, for that--young King Richard thus removed,
Leaving no heir begotten of his body--
I was the next by birth and parentage;
For by my mother I derived am
From Lionel Duke of Clarence, the third son
To King Edward the Third; whereas he
From John of Gaunt doth bring his pedigree,
Being but fourth of that heroic line.
But mark: as in this haughty attempt
They laboured to plant the rightful heir,
I lost my liberty and they their lives.
Long after this, when Henry the Fifth,
Succeeding his father Bolingbroke, did reign,
Thy father, Earl of Cambridge, then derived
From famous Edmund Langley, Duke of York,
Marrying my sister that thy mother was,
Again in pity of my hard distress
Levied an army, weening to redeem
And have install&apos;d me in the diadem:
But, as the rest, so fell that noble earl
And was beheaded. Thus the Mortimers,
In whom the tide rested, were suppress&apos;d.</string>

		<string>Welcome, brave captain and victorious lord!
When I was young, as yet I am not old,
I do remember how my father said
A stouter champion never handled sword.
Long since we were resolved of your truth,
Your faithful service and your toil in war;
Yet never have you tasted our reward,
Or been reguerdon&apos;d with so much as thanks,
Because till now we never saw your face:
Therefore, stand up; and, for these good deserts,
We here create you Earl of Shrewsbury;
And in our coronation take your place.</string>

		<string>Come hither, you that would be combatants:
Henceforth I charge you, as you love our favour,
Quite to forget this quarrel and the cause.
And you, my lords, remember where we are,
In France, amongst a fickle wavering nation:
If they perceive dissension in our looks
And that within ourselves we disagree,
How will their grudging stomachs be provoked
To wilful disobedience, and rebel!
Beside, what infamy will there arise,
When foreign princes shall be certified
That for a toy, a thing of no regard,
King Henry&apos;s peers and chief nobility
Destroy&apos;d themselves, and lost the realm of France!
O, think upon the conquest of my father,
My tender years, and let us not forego
That for a trifle that was bought with blood
Let me be umpire in this doubtful strife.
I see no reason, if I wear this rose,

[Putting on a red rose]

That any one should therefore be suspicious
I more incline to Somerset than York:
Both are my kinsmen, and I love them both:
As well they may upbraid me with my crown,
Because, forsooth, the king of Scots is crown&apos;d.
But your discretions better can persuade
Than I am able to instruct or teach:
And therefore, as we hither came in peace,
So let us still continue peace and love.
Cousin of York, we institute your grace
To be our regent in these parts of France:
And, good my Lord of Somerset, unite
Your troops of horsemen with his bands of foot;
And, like true subjects, sons of your progenitors,
Go cheerfully together and digest.
Your angry choler on your enemies.
Ourself, my lord protector and the rest
After some respite will return to Calais;
From thence to England; where I hope ere long
To be presented, by your victories,
With Charles, Alencon and that traitorous rout.</string>

Our nation&apos;s terror and their bloody scourge!
The period of thy tyranny approacheth.
On us thou canst not enter but by death;
For, I protest, we are well fortified
And strong enough to issue out and fight:
If thou retire, the Dauphin, well appointed,
Stands with the snares of war to tangle thee:
On either hand thee there are squadrons pitch&apos;d,
To wall thee from the liberty of flight;
And no way canst thou turn thee for redress,
But death doth front thee with apparent spoil
And pale destruction meets thee in the face.
Ten thousand French have ta&apos;en the sacrament
To rive their dangerous artillery
Upon no Christian soul but English Talbot.
Lo, there thou stand&apos;st, a breathing valiant man,
Of an invincible unconquer&apos;d spirit!
This is the latest glory of thy praise
That I, thy enemy, due thee withal;
For ere the glass, that now begins to run,
Finish the process of his sandy hour,
These eyes, that see thee now well coloured,
Shall see thee wither&apos;d, bloody, pale and dead.</string>

A little herd of England&apos;s timorous deer,
Mazed with a yelping kennel of French curs!
If we be English deer, be then in blood;
Not rascal-like, to fall down with a pinch,
But rather, moody-mad and desperate stags,
Turn on the bloody hounds with heads of steel
And make the cowards stand aloof at bay:
Sell every man his life as dear as mine,
And they shall find dear deer of us, my friends.

Prosper our colours in this dangerous fight!</string>

Whither, my lord? from bought and sold Lord Talbot;
Who, ring&apos;d about with bold adversity,
Cries out for noble York and Somerset,
To beat assailing death from his weak legions:
And whiles the honourable captain there
Drops bloody sweat from his war-wearied limbs,
And, in advantage lingering, looks for rescue,
You, his false hopes, the trust of England&apos;s honour,
Keep off aloof with worthless emulation.
Let not your private discord keep away
The levied succors that should lend him aid,
While he, renowned noble gentleman,
Yields up his life unto a world of odds:
Orléans the Bastard, Charles, Burgundy,
Alencon, Reignier, compass him about,
And Talbot perisheth by your default.</string>

		<string>When from the Dauphin&apos;s crest thy sword struck fire,
It warm&apos;d thy father&apos;s heart with proud desire
Of bold-faced victory. Then leaden age,
Quicken&apos;d with youthful spleen and warlike rage,
Beat down Alencon, Orléans, Burgundy,
And from the pride of Gallia rescued thee.
The ireful bastard Orleans, that drew blood
From thee, my boy, and had the maidenhood
Of thy first fight, I soon encountered,
And interchanging blows I quickly shed
Some of his bastard blood; and in disgrace
Bespoke him thus; &apos;Contaminated, base
And misbegotten blood I spill of thine,
Mean and right poor, for that pure blood of mine
Which thou didst force from Talbot, my brave boy:&apos;
Here, purposing the Bastard to destroy,
Came in strong rescue. Speak, thy father&apos;s care,
Art thou not weary, John? how dost thou fare?
Wilt thou yet leave the battle, boy, and fly,
Now thou art seal&apos;d the son of chivalry?
Fly, to revenge my death when I am dead:
The help of one stands me in little stead.
O, too much folly is it, well I wot,
To hazard all our lives in one small boat!
If I to-day die not with Frenchmen&apos;s rage,
To-morrow I shall die with mickle age:
By me they nothing gain an if I stay;
&apos;Tis but the shortening of my life one day:
In thee thy mother dies, our household&apos;s name,
My death&apos;s revenge, thy youth, and England&apos;s fame:
All these and more we hazard by thy stay;
All these are saved if thou wilt fly away.</string>

O, where&apos;s young Talbot? where is valiant John?
Triumphant death, smear&apos;d with captivity,
Young Talbot&apos;s valour makes me smile at thee:
When he perceived me shrink and on my knee,
His bloody sword he brandish&apos;d over me,
And, like a hungry lion, did commence
Rough deeds of rage and stern impatience;
But when my angry guardant stood alone,
Tendering my ruin and assail&apos;d of none,
Dizzy-eyed fury and great rage of heart
Suddenly made him from my side to start
Into the clustering battle of the French;
And in that sea of blood my boy did drench
His over-mounting spirit, and there died,
My Icarus, my blossom, in his pride.

[O, my dear lord, lo, where your son is borne!]

Thou antic death, which laugh&apos;st us here to scorn,
Anon, from thy insulting tyranny,
Coupled in bonds of perpetuity,
Two Talbots, winged through the lither sky,
In thy despite shall &apos;scape mortality.
O, thou, whose wounds become hard-favour&apos;d death,
Speak to thy father ere thou yield thy breath!
Brave death by speaking, whether he will or no;
Imagine him a Frenchman and thy foe.
Poor boy! he smiles, methinks, as who should say,
Had death been French, then death had died to-day.
Come, come and lay him in his father&apos;s arms:
My spirit can no longer bear these harms.
Soldiers, adieu! I have what I would have,
Now my old arms are young John Talbot&apos;s grave.</string>

So you do condescend to help me now.

No hope to have redress? My body shall
Pay recompense, if you will grant my suit.

Cannot my body nor blood-sacrifice
Entreat you to your wonted furtherance?
Then take my soul, my body, soul and all,
Before that England give the French the foil.

See, they forsake me! Now the time is come

And let her head fall into England&apos;s lap.

Stain&apos;d with the guiltless blood of innocents,
Corrupt and tainted with a thousand vices,
Because you want the grace that others have,
You judge it straight a thing impossible
To compass wonders but by help of devils.
No, misconceived! Joan of Arc hath been
A virgin from her tender infancy,
Chaste and immaculate in very thought;
Whose maiden blood, thus rigorously effused,
Will cry for vengeance at the gates of heaven.</string>

		<string>As by your high imperial majesty
I had in charge at my depart for France,
As procurator to your excellence,
To marry Princess Margaret for your grace,
So, in the famous ancient city, Tours,
In presence of the Kings of France and Sicil,
The Dukes of Orleans, Calaber, Bretagne and Alencon,
Seven earls, twelve barons and twenty reverend bishops,
I have perform&apos;d my task and was espoused:
And humbly now upon my bended knee,
In sight of England and her lordly peers,
Deliver up my title in the queen
To your most gracious hands, that are the substance
Of that great shadow I did represent;
The happiest gift that ever marquess gave,
The fairest queen that ever king received.</string>

		<string>Brave peers of England, pillars of the state,
To you Duke Humphrey must unload his grief,
Your grief, the common grief of all the land.
What! did my brother Henry spend his youth,
His valour, coin and people, in the wars?
Did he so often lodge in open field,
In winter&apos;s cold and summer&apos;s parching heat,
To conquer France, his true inheritance?
And did my brother Bedford toil his wits,
To keep by policy what Henry got?
Have you yourselves, Somerset, Buckingham,
Brave York, Salisbury, and victorious Warwick,
Received deep scars in France and Normandy?
Or hath mine uncle Beaufort and myself,
With all the learned council of the realm,
Studied so long, sat in the council-house
Early and late, debating to and fro
How France and Frenchmen might be kept in awe,
And had his highness in his infancy
Crowned in Paris in despite of foes?
And shall these labours and these honours die?
Shall Henry&apos;s conquest, Bedford&apos;s vigilance,
Your deeds of war and all our counsel die?
O peers of England, shameful is this league!
Fatal this marriage, cancelling your fame,
Blotting your names from books of memory,
Razing the characters of your renown,
Defacing monuments of conquer&apos;d France,
Undoing all, as all had never been!</string>

&apos;Tis known to you he is mine enemy,
Nay, more, an enemy unto you all,
And no great friend, I fear me, to the king.
Consider, lords, he is the next of blood,
And heir apparent to the English crown:
Had Henry got an empire by his marriage,
And all the wealthy kingdoms of the west,
There&apos;s reason he should be displeased at it.
Look to it, lords! let not his smoothing words
Bewitch your hearts; be wise and circumspect.
What though the common people favour him,
Calling him &apos;Humphrey, the good Duke of
Gloucester,&apos;
Clapping their hands, and crying with loud voice,
&apos;Jesu maintain your royal excellence!&apos;
With &apos;God preserve the good Duke Humphrey!&apos;
I fear me, lords, for all this flattering gloss,
He will be found a dangerous protector.</string>

		<string>Pride went before, ambition follows him.
While these do labour for their own preferment,
Behoves it us to labour for the realm.
I never saw but Humphrey Duke of Gloucester
Did bear him like a noble gentleman.
Oft have I seen the haughty cardinal,
More like a soldier than a man o&apos; the church,
As stout and proud as he were lord of all,
Swear like a ruffian and demean himself
Unlike the ruler of a commonweal.
Warwick, my son, the comfort of my age,
Thy deeds, thy plainness and thy housekeeping,
Hath won the greatest favour of the commons,
Excepting none but good Duke Humphrey:
And, brother York, thy acts in Ireland,
In bringing them to civil discipline,
Thy late exploits done in the heart of France,
When thou wert regent for our sovereign,
Have made thee fear&apos;d and honour&apos;d of the people:
Join we together, for the public good,
In what we can, to bridle and suppress
The pride of Suffolk and the cardinal,
With Somerset&apos;s and Buckingham&apos;s ambition;
And, as we may, cherish Duke Humphrey&apos;s deeds,
While they do tend the profit of the land.</string>

		<string>Anjou and Maine are given to the French;
Paris is lost; the state of Normandy
Stands on a tickle point, now they are gone:
Suffolk concluded on the articles,
The peers agreed, and Henry was well pleased
To change two dukedoms for a duke&apos;s fair daughter.
I cannot blame them all: what is&apos;t to them?
&apos;Tis thine they give away, and not their own.
Pirates may make cheap pennyworths of their pillage
And purchase friends and give to courtezans,
Still revelling like lords till all be gone;
While as the silly owner of the goods
Weeps over them and wrings his hapless hands
And shakes his head and trembling stands aloof,
While all is shared and all is borne away,
Ready to starve and dare not touch his own:
So York must sit and fret and bite his tongue,
While his own lands are bargain&apos;d for and sold.
Methinks the realms of England, France and Ireland
Bear that proportion to my flesh and blood
As did the fatal brand Althaea burn&apos;d
Unto the prince&apos;s heart of Calydon.
Anjou and Maine both given unto the French!
Cold news for me, for I had hope of France,
Even as I have of fertile England&apos;s soil.
A day will come when York shall claim his own;
And therefore I will take the Nevils&apos; parts
And make a show of love to proud Duke Humphrey,
And, when I spy advantage, claim the crown,
For that&apos;s the golden mark I seek to hit:
Nor shall proud Lancaster usurp my right,
Nor hold the sceptre in his childish fist,
Nor wear the diadem upon his head,
Whose church-like humours fits not for a crown.
Then, York, be still awhile, till time do serve:
Watch thou and wake when others be asleep,
To pry into the secrets of the state;
Till Henry, surfeiting in joys of love,
With his new bride and England&apos;s dear-bought queen,
And Humphrey with the peers be fall&apos;n at jars:
Then will I raise aloft the milk-white rose,
With whose sweet smell the air shall be perfumed;
And in my standard bear the arms of York
To grapple with the house of Lancaster;
And, force perforce, I&apos;ll make him yield the crown,
Whose bookish rule hath pull&apos;d fair England down.</string>

Why are thine eyes fixed to the sullen earth,
Gazing on that which seems to dim thy sight?
What seest thou there? King Henry&apos;s diadem,
Enchased with all the honours of the world?
If so, gaze on, and grovel on thy face,
Until thy head be circled with the same.
Put forth thy hand, reach at the glorious gold.

		<string>The crickets sing, and man&apos;s o&apos;er-labour&apos;d sense
Repairs itself by rest. Our Tarquin thus
Did softly press the rushes, ere he waken&apos;d
The chastity he wounded. Cytherea,
How bravely thou becomest thy bed, fresh lily,
And whiter than the sheets! That I might touch!
But kiss; one kiss! Rubies unparagon&apos;d,
How dearly they do&apos;t! &apos;Tis her breathing that
Perfumes the chamber thus: the flame o&apos; the taper
Bows toward her, and would under-peep her lids,
To see the enclosed lights, now canopied
Under these windows, white and azure laced
With blue of heaven&apos;s own tinct. But my design,
To note the chamber: I will write all down:
Such and such pictures; there the window; such
The adornment of her bed; the arras; figures,
Why, such and such; and the contents o&apos; the story.
Ah, but some natural notes about her body,
Above ten thousand meaner moveables
Would testify, to enrich mine inventory.
O sleep, thou ape of death, lie dull upon her!
And be her sense but as a monument,
Thus in a chapel lying! Come off, come off:
[Taking off her bracelet]
As slippery as the Gordian knot was hard!
&apos;Tis mine; and this will witness outwardly,
As strongly as the conscience does within,
To the madding of her lord. On her left breast
A mole cinque-spotted, like the crimson drops
I&apos; the bottom of a cowslip: here&apos;s a voucher,
Stronger than ever law could make: this secret
Will force him think I have pick&apos;d the lock and ta&apos;en
The treasure of her honour. No more. To what end?
Why should I write this down, that&apos;s riveted,
Screw&apos;d to my memory? She hath been reading late
The tale of Tereus; here the leaf&apos;s turn&apos;d down
Where Philomel gave up. I have enough:
To the trunk again, and shut the spring of it.
Swift, swift, you dragons of the night, that dawning
May bare the raven&apos;s eye! I lodge in fear;
Though this a heavenly angel, hell is here.</string>

Seized on the realm, deposed the rightful king,
Sent his poor queen to France, from whence she came,
And him to Pomfret; where, as all you know,
Harmless Richard was murder&apos;d traitorously.</string>

		<string>Ah, Gloucester, teach me to forget myself!
For whilst I think I am thy married wife
And thou a prince, protector of this land,
Methinks I should not thus be led along,
Mail&apos;d up in shame, with papers on my back,
And followed with a rabble that rejoice
To see my tears and hear my deep-fet groans.
The ruthless flint doth cut my tender feet,
And when I start, the envious people laugh
And bid me be advised how I tread.
Ah, Humphrey, can I bear this shameful yoke?
Trow&apos;st thou that e&apos;er I&apos;ll look upon the world,
Or count them happy that enjoy the sun?
No; dark shall be my light and night my day;
To think upon my pomp shall be my hell.
Sometime I&apos;ll say, I am Duke Humphrey&apos;s wife,
And he a prince and ruler of the land:
Yet so he ruled and such a prince he was
As he stood by whilst I, his forlorn duchess,
Was made a wonder and a pointing-stock
To every idle rascal follower.
But be thou mild and blush not at my shame,
Nor stir at nothing till the axe of death
Hang over thee, as, sure, it shortly will;
For Suffolk, he that can do all in all
With her that hateth thee and hates us all,
And York and impious Beaufort, that false priest,
Have all limed bushes to betray thy wings,
And, fly thou how thou canst, they&apos;ll tangle thee:
But fear not thou, until thy foot be snared,
Nor never seek prevention of thy foes.</string>

		<string>Can you not see? or will ye not observe
The strangeness of his alter&apos;d countenance?
With what a majesty he bears himself,
How insolent of late he is become,
How proud, how peremptory, and unlike himself?
We know the time since he was mild and affable,
And if we did but glance a far-off look,
Immediately he was upon his knee,
That all the court admired him for submission:
But meet him now, and, be it in the morn,
When every one will give the time of day,
He knits his brow and shows an angry eye,
And passeth by with stiff unbowed knee,
Disdaining duty that to us belongs.
Small curs are not regarded when they grin;
But great men tremble when the lion roars;
And Humphrey is no little man in England.
First note that he is near you in descent,
And should you fall, he as the next will mount.
Me seemeth then it is no policy,
Respecting what a rancorous mind he bears
And his advantage following your decease,
That he should come about your royal person
Or be admitted to your highness&apos; council.
By flattery hath he won the commons&apos; hearts,
And when he please to make commotion,
&apos;Tis to be fear&apos;d they all will follow him.
Now &apos;tis the spring, and weeds are shallow-rooted;
Suffer them now, and they&apos;ll o&apos;ergrow the garden
And choke the herbs for want of husbandry.
The reverent care I bear unto my lord
Made me collect these dangers in the duke.
If it be fond, call it a woman&apos;s fear;
Which fear if better reasons can supplant,
I will subscribe and say I wrong&apos;d the duke.
My Lord of Suffolk, Buckingham, and York,
Reprove my allegation, if you can;
Or else conclude my words effectual.</string>

		<string>Ah, gracious lord, these days are dangerous:
Virtue is choked with foul ambition
And charity chased hence by rancour&apos;s hand;
Foul subornation is predominant
And equity exiled your highness&apos; land.
I know their complot is to have my life,
And if my death might make this island happy,
And prove the period of their tyranny,
I would expend it with all willingness:
But mine is made the prologue to their play;
For thousands more, that yet suspect no peril,
Will not conclude their plotted tragedy.
Beaufort&apos;s red sparkling eyes blab his heart&apos;s malice,
And Suffolk&apos;s cloudy brow his stormy hate;
Sharp Buckingham unburthens with his tongue
The envious load that lies upon his heart;
And dogged York, that reaches at the moon,
Whose overweening arm I have pluck&apos;d back,
By false accuse doth level at my life:
And you, my sovereign lady, with the rest,
Causeless have laid disgraces on my head,
And with your best endeavour have stirr&apos;d up
My liefest liege to be mine enemy:
Ay, all you have laid your heads together--
Myself had notice of your conventicles--
And all to make away my guiltless life.
I shall not want false witness to condemn me,
Nor store of treasons to augment my guilt;
The ancient proverb will be well effected:
&apos;A staff is quickly found to beat a dog.&apos;</string>

		<string>Ay, Margaret; my heart is drown&apos;d with grief,
Whose flood begins to flow within mine eyes,
My body round engirt with misery,
For what&apos;s more miserable than discontent?
Ah, uncle Humphrey! in thy face I see
The map of honour, truth and loyalty:
And yet, good Humphrey, is the hour to come
That e&apos;er I proved thee false or fear&apos;d thy faith.
What louring star now envies thy estate,
That these great lords and Margaret our queen
Do seek subversion of thy harmless life?
Thou never didst them wrong, nor no man wrong;
And as the butcher takes away the calf
And binds the wretch, and beats it when it strays,
Bearing it to the bloody slaughter-house,
Even so remorseless have they borne him hence;
And as the dam runs lowing up and down,
Looking the way her harmless young one went,
And can do nought but wail her darling&apos;s loss,
Even so myself bewails good Gloucester&apos;s case
With sad unhelpful tears, and with dimm&apos;d eyes
Look after him and cannot do him good,
So mighty are his vowed enemies.
His fortunes I will weep; and, &apos;twixt each groan
Say &apos;Who&apos;s a traitor? Gloucester he is none.&apos;</string>

		<string>Now, York, or never, steel thy fearful thoughts,
And change misdoubt to resolution:
Be that thou hopest to be, or what thou art
Resign to death; it is not worth the enjoying:
Let pale-faced fear keep with the mean-born man,
And find no harbour in a royal heart.
Faster than spring-time showers comes thought
on thought,
And not a thought but thinks on dignity.
My brain more busy than the labouring spider
Weaves tedious snares to trap mine enemies.
Well, nobles, well, &apos;tis politicly done,
To send me packing with an host of men:
I fear me you but warm the starved snake,
Who, cherish&apos;d in your breasts, will sting
your hearts.
&apos;Twas men I lack&apos;d and you will give them me:
I take it kindly; and yet be well assured
You put sharp weapons in a madman&apos;s hands.
Whiles I in Ireland nourish a mighty band,
I will stir up in England some black storm
Shall blow ten thousand souls to heaven or hell;
And this fell tempest shall not cease to rage
Until the golden circuit on my head,
Like to the glorious sun&apos;s transparent beams,
Do calm the fury of this mad-bred flaw.
And, for a minister of my intent,
I have seduced a headstrong Kentishman,
John Cade of Ashford,
To make commotion, as full well he can,
Under the title of John Mortimer.
In Ireland have I seen this stubborn Cade
Oppose himself against a troop of kerns,
And fought so long, till that his thighs with darts
Were almost like a sharp-quill&apos;d porpentine;
And, in the end being rescued, I have seen
Him caper upright like a wild Morisco,
Shaking the bloody darts as he his bells.
Full often, like a shag-hair&apos;d crafty kern,
Hath he conversed with the enemy,
And undiscover&apos;d come to me again
And given me notice of their villanies.
This devil here shall be my substitute;
For that John Mortimer, which now is dead,
In face, in gait, in speech, he doth resemble:
By this I shall perceive the commons&apos; mind,
How they affect the house and claim of York.
Say he be taken, rack&apos;d and tortured,
I know no pain they can inflict upon him
Will make him say I moved him to those arms.
Say that he thrive, as &apos;tis great like he will,
Why, then from Ireland come I with my strength
And reap the harvest which that rascal sow&apos;d;
For Humphrey being dead, as he shall be,
And Henry put apart, the next for me.</string>

What, dost thou turn away and hide thy face?
I am no loathsome leper; look on me.
What! art thou, like the adder, waxen deaf?
Be poisonous too and kill thy forlorn queen.
Is all thy comfort shut in Gloucester&apos;s tomb?
Why, then, dame Margaret was ne&apos;er thy joy.
Erect his statue and worship it,
And make my image but an alehouse sign.
Was I for this nigh wreck&apos;d upon the sea
And twice by awkward wind from England&apos;s bank
Drove back again unto my native clime?
What boded this, but well forewarning wind
Did seem to say &apos;Seek not a scorpion&apos;s nest,
Nor set no footing on this unkind shore&apos;?
What did I then, but cursed the gentle gusts
And he that loosed them forth their brazen caves:
And bid them blow towards England&apos;s blessed shore,
Or turn our stern upon a dreadful rock
Yet AEolus would not be a murderer,
But left that hateful office unto thee:
The pretty-vaulting sea refused to drown me,
Knowing that thou wouldst have me drown&apos;d on shore,
With tears as salt as sea, through thy unkindness:
The splitting rocks cower&apos;d in the sinking sands
And would not dash me with their ragged sides,
Because thy flinty heart, more hard than they,
Might in thy palace perish Margaret.
As far as I could ken thy chalky cliffs,
When from thy shore the tempest beat us back,
I stood upon the hatches in the storm,
And when the dusky sky began to rob
My earnest-gaping sight of thy land&apos;s view,
I took a costly jewel from my neck,
A heart it was, bound in with diamonds,
And threw it towards thy land: the sea received it,
And so I wish&apos;d thy body might my heart:
And even with this I lost fair England&apos;s view
And bid mine eyes be packing with my heart
And call&apos;d them blind and dusky spectacles,
For losing ken of Albion&apos;s wished coast.
How often have I tempted Suffolk&apos;s tongue,
The agent of thy foul inconstancy,
To sit and witch me, as Ascanius did
When he to madding Dido would unfold
His father&apos;s acts commenced in burning Troy!
Am I not witch&apos;d like her? or thou not false like him?
Ay me, I can no more! die, Margaret!
For Henry weeps that thou dost live so long.</string>

Oft have I seen a timely-parted ghost,
Of ashy semblance, meagre, pale and bloodless,
Being all descended to the labouring heart;
Who, in the conflict that it holds with death,
Attracts the same for aidance &apos;gainst the enemy;
Which with the heart there cools and ne&apos;er returneth
To blush and beautify the cheek again.
But see, his face is black and full of blood,
His eye-balls further out than when he lived,
Staring full ghastly like a strangled man;
His hair uprear&apos;d, his nostrils stretched with struggling;
His hands abroad display&apos;d, as one that grasp&apos;d
And tugg&apos;d for life and was by strength subdued:
Look, on the sheets his hair you see, is sticking;
His well-proportion&apos;d beard made rough and rugged,
Like to the summer&apos;s corn by tempest lodged.
It cannot be but he was murder&apos;d here;
The least of all these signs were probable.</string>

Unless Lord Suffolk straight be done to death,
Or banished fair England&apos;s territories,
They will by violence tear him from your palace
And torture him with grievous lingering death.
They say, by him the good Duke Humphrey died;
They say, in him they fear your highness&apos; death;
And mere instinct of love and loyalty,
Free from a stubborn opposite intent,
As being thought to contradict your liking,
Makes them thus forward in his banishment.
They say, in care of your most royal person,
That if your highness should intend to sleep
And charge that no man should disturb your rest
In pain of your dislike or pain of death,
Yet, notwithstanding such a strait edict,
Were there a serpent seen, with forked tongue,
That slily glided towards your majesty,
It were but necessary you were waked,
Lest, being suffer&apos;d in that harmful slumber,
The mortal worm might make the sleep eternal;
And therefore do they cry, though you forbid,
That they will guard you, whether you will or no,
From such fell serpents as false Suffolk is,
With whose envenomed and fatal sting,
Your loving uncle, twenty times his worth,
They say, is shamefully bereft of life.</string>

		<string>A plague upon them! wherefore should I curse them?
Would curses kill, as doth the mandrake&apos;s groan,
I would invent as bitter-searching terms,
As curst, as harsh and horrible to hear,
Deliver&apos;d strongly through my fixed teeth,
With full as many signs of deadly hate,
As lean-faced Envy in her loathsome cave:
My tongue should stumble in mine earnest words;
Mine eyes should sparkle like the beaten flint;
Mine hair be fixed on end, as one distract;
Ay, every joint should seem to curse and ban:
And even now my burthen&apos;d heart would break,
Should I not curse them. Poison be their drink!
Gall, worse than gall, the daintiest that they taste!
Their sweetest shade a grove of cypress trees!
Their chiefest prospect murdering basilisks!
Their softest touch as smart as lizards&apos; sting!
Their music frightful as the serpent&apos;s hiss,
And boding screech-owls make the concert full!
All the foul terrors in dark-seated hell--</string>

		<string>O, let me entreat thee cease. Give me thy hand,
That I may dew it with my mournful tears;
Nor let the rain of heaven wet this place,
To wash away my woful monuments.
O, could this kiss be printed in thy hand,
That thou mightst think upon these by the seal,
Through whom a thousand sighs are breathed for thee!
So, get thee gone, that I may know my grief;
&apos;Tis but surmised whiles thou art standing by,
As one that surfeits thinking on a want.
I will repeal thee, or, be well assured,
Adventure to be banished myself:
And banished I am, if but from thee.
Go; speak not to me; even now be gone.
O, go not yet! Even thus two friends condemn&apos;d
Embrace and kiss and take ten thousand leaves,
Loather a hundred times to part than die.
Yet now farewell; and farewell life with thee!</string>

But like a pleasant slumber in thy lap?
Here could I breathe my soul into the air,
As mild and gentle as the cradle-babe
Dying with mother&apos;s dug between its lips:
Where, from thy sight, I should be raging mad,
And cry out for thee to close up mine eyes,
To have thee with thy lips to stop my mouth;
So shouldst thou either turn my flying soul,
Or I should breathe it so into thy body,
And then it lived in sweet Elysium.
To die by thee were but to die in jest;
From thee to die were torture more than death:
O, let me stay, befall what may befall!</string>

That knew the stars as I his characters;

Of my lord&apos;s health, of his content, yet not

Some griefs are med&apos;cinable; that is one of them,
For it doth physic love: of his content,
All but in that! Good wax, thy leave. Blest be

Though forfeiters you cast in prison, yet
You clasp young Cupid&apos;s tables. Good news, gods!

But in a fainter kind:--O, not like me;
For mine&apos;s beyond beyond--say, and speak thick;
Love&apos;s counsellor should fill the bores of hearing,
To the smothering of the sense--how far it is
To this same blessed Milford: and by the way
Tell me how Wales was made so happy as
To inherit such a haven: but first of all,
How we may steal from hence, and for the gap
That we shall make in time, from our hence-going
And our return, to excuse: but first, how get hence:
Why should excuse be born or e&apos;er begot?
We&apos;ll talk of that hereafter. Prithee, speak,

Ay, kennel, puddle, sink; whose filth and dirt
Troubles the silver spring where England drinks.
Now will I dam up this thy yawning mouth
For swallowing the treasure of the realm:
Thy lips that kiss&apos;d the queen shall sweep the ground;
And thou that smiledst at good Duke Humphrey&apos;s death,
Against the senseless winds shalt grin in vain,
Who in contempt shall hiss at thee again:
And wedded be thou to the hags of hell,
For daring to affy a mighty lord
Unto the daughter of a worthless king,
Having neither subject, wealth, nor diadem.
By devilish policy art thou grown great,
And, like ambitious Sylla, overgorged
With gobbets of thy mother&apos;s bleeding heart.
By thee Anjou and Maine were sold to France,
The false revolting Normans thorough thee
Disdain to call us lord, and Picardy
Hath slain their governors, surprised our forts,
And sent the ragged soldiers wounded home.
The princely Warwick, and the Nevils all,
Whose dreadful swords were never drawn in vain,
As hating thee, are rising up in arms:
And now the house of York, thrust from the crown
By shameful murder of a guiltless king
And lofty proud encroaching tyranny,
Burns with revenging fire; whose hopeful colours
Advance our half-faced sun, striving to shine,
Under the which is writ &apos;Invitis nubibus.&apos;
The commons here in Kent are up in arms:
And, to conclude, reproach and beggary
Is crept into the palace of our king.
And all by thee. Away! convey him hence.</string>

Kent, in the Commentaries Caesar writ,
Is term&apos;d the civil&apos;st place of this isle:
Sweet is the country, because full of riches;
The people liberal, valiant, active, wealthy;
Which makes me hope you are not void of pity.
I sold not Maine, I lost not Normandy,
Yet, to recover them, would lose my life.
Justice with favour have I always done;
Prayers and tears have moved me, gifts could never.
When have I aught exacted at your hands,
But to maintain the king, the realm and you?
Large gifts have I bestow&apos;d on learned clerks,
Because my book preferr&apos;d me to the king,
And seeing ignorance is the curse of God,
Knowledge the wing wherewith we fly to heaven,
Unless you be possess&apos;d with devilish spirits,
You cannot but forbear to murder me:
This tongue hath parley&apos;d unto foreign kings
For your behoof,--</string>

And, in thy reverence and thy chair-days, thus

No more will I their babes: tears virginal
Shall be to me even as the dew to fire,
And beauty that the tyrant oft reclaims
Shall to my flaming wrath be oil and flax.
Henceforth I will not have to do with pity:
Meet I an infant of the house of York,
Into as many gobbets will I cut it
As wild Medea young Absyrtus did:
In cruelty will I seek out my fame.
Come, thou new ruin of old Clifford&apos;s house:
As did AEneas old Anchises bear,
So bear I thee upon my manly shoulders;
But then AEneas bare a living load,

Both from thy table, Henry, and thy bed,
Until that act of parliament be repeal&apos;d

Will follow mine, if once they see them spread;

And all my followers to the eager foe
Turn back and fly, like ships before the wind

My sons, God knows what hath bechanced them:

Like men born to renown by life or death.
Three times did Richard make a lane to me.
And thrice cried &apos;Courage, father! fight it out!&apos;
And full as oft came Edward to my side,
With purple falchion, painted to the hilt
In blood of those that had encounter&apos;d him:
And when the hardiest warriors did retire,
Richard cried &apos;Charge! and give no foot of ground!&apos;
And cried &apos;A crown, or else a glorious tomb!
A sceptre, or an earthly sepulchre!&apos;
With this, we charged again: but, out, alas!
We bodged again; as I have seen a swan
With bootless labour swim against the tide
And spend her strength with over-matching waves.

[A short alarum within]

Ah, hark! the fatal followers do pursue;
And I am faint and cannot fly their fury:
And were I strong, I would not shun their fury:
The sands are number&apos;d that make up my life;
Here must I stay, and here my life must end.

		<string>Brave warriors, Clifford and Northumberland,
Come, make him stand upon this molehill here,
That raught at mountains with outstretched arms,
Yet parted but the shadow with his hand.
What! was it you that would be England&apos;s king?
Was&apos;t you that revell&apos;d in our parliament,
And made a preachment of your high descent?
Where are your mess of sons to back you now?
The wanton Edward, and the lusty George?
And where&apos;s that valiant crook-back prodigy,
Dicky your boy, that with his grumbling voice
Was wont to cheer his dad in mutinies?
Or, with the rest, where is your darling Rutland?
Look, York: I stain&apos;d this napkin with the blood
That valiant Clifford, with his rapier&apos;s point,
Made issue from the bosom of the boy;
And if thine eyes can water for his death,
I give thee this to dry thy cheeks withal.
Alas poor York! but that I hate thee deadly,
I should lament thy miserable state.
I prithee, grieve, to make me merry, York.
What, hath thy fiery heart so parch&apos;d thine entrails
That not a tear can fall for Rutland&apos;s death?
Why art thou patient, man? thou shouldst be mad;
And I, to make thee mad, do mock thee thus.
Stamp, rave, and fret, that I may sing and dance.
Thou wouldst be fee&apos;d, I see, to make me sport:
York cannot speak, unless he wear a crown.
A crown for York! and, lords, bow low to him:
Hold you his hands, whilst I do set it on.

[Putting a paper crown on his head]

Ay, marry, sir, now looks he like a king!
Ay, this is he that took King Henry&apos;s chair,
And this is he was his adopted heir.
But how is it that great Plantagenet
Is crown&apos;d so soon, and broke his solemn oath?
As I bethink me, you should not be king
Till our King Henry had shook hands with death.
And will you pale your head in Henry&apos;s glory,
And rob his temples of the diadem,
Now in his life, against your holy oath?
O, &apos;tis a fault too too unpardonable!
Off with the crown, and with the crown his head;
And, whilst we breathe, take time to do him dead.</string>

		<string>She-wolf of France, but worse than wolves of France,
Whose tongue more poisons than the adder&apos;s tooth!
How ill-beseeming is it in thy sex
To triumph, like an Amazonian trull,
Upon their woes whom fortune captivates!
But that thy face is, vizard-like, unchanging,
Made impudent with use of evil deeds,
I would assay, proud queen, to make thee blush.
To tell thee whence thou camest, of whom derived,
Were shame enough to shame thee, wert thou not shameless.
Thy father bears the type of King of Naples,
Of both the Sicils and Jerusalem,
Yet not so wealthy as an English yeoman.
Hath that poor monarch taught thee to insult?
It needs not, nor it boots thee not, proud queen,
Unless the adage must be verified,
That beggars mounted run their horse to death.
&apos;Tis beauty that doth oft make women proud;
But, God he knows, thy share thereof is small:
&apos;Tis virtue that doth make them most admired;
The contrary doth make thee wonder&apos;d at:
&apos;Tis government that makes them seem divine;
The want thereof makes thee abominable:
Thou art as opposite to every good
As the Antipodes are unto us,
Or as the south to the septentrion.
O tiger&apos;s heart wrapt in a woman&apos;s hide!
How couldst thou drain the life-blood of the child,
To bid the father wipe his eyes withal,
And yet be seen to bear a woman&apos;s face?
Women are soft, mild, pitiful and flexible;
Thou stern, obdurate, flinty, rough, remorseless.
Bids&apos;t thou me rage? why, now thou hast thy wish:
Wouldst have me weep? why, now thou hast thy will:
For raging wind blows up incessant showers,
And when the rage allays, the rain begins.
These tears are my sweet Rutland&apos;s obsequies:
And every drop cries vengeance for his death,
&apos;Gainst thee, fell Clifford, and thee, false
Frenchwoman.</string>

		<string>A goodly day not to keep house, with such
Whose roof&apos;s as low as ours! Stoop, boys; this gate
Instructs you how to adore the heavens and bows you
To a morning&apos;s holy office: the gates of monarchs
Are arch&apos;d so high that giants may jet through
And keep their impious turbans on, without
Good morrow to the sun. Hail, thou fair heaven!
We house i&apos; the rock, yet use thee not so hardly
As prouder livers do.

Now for our mountain sport: up to yond hill;
Your legs are young; I&apos;ll tread these flats. Consider,
When you above perceive me like a crow,
That it is place which lessens and sets off;
And you may then revolve what tales I have told you
Of courts, of princes, of the tricks in war:
This service is not service, so being done,
But being so allow&apos;d: to apprehend thus,
Draws us a profit from all things we see;
And often, to our comfort, shall we find
The sharded beetle in a safer hold
Than is the full-wing&apos;d eagle. O, this life
Is nobler than attending for a cheque,
Richer than doing nothing for a bauble,
Prouder than rustling in unpaid-for silk:
Such gain the cap of him that makes &apos;em fine,
Yet keeps his book uncross&apos;d: no life to ours.</string>

		<string>I cannot joy, until I be resolved
Where our right valiant father is become.
I saw him in the battle range about;
And watch&apos;d him how he singled Clifford forth.
Methought he bore him in the thickest troop
As doth a lion in a herd of neat;
Or as a bear, encompass&apos;d round with dogs,
Who having pinch&apos;d a few and made them cry,
The rest stand all aloof, and bark at him.
So fared our father with his enemies;
So fled his enemies my warlike father:
Methinks, &apos;tis prize enough to be his son.
See how the morning opes her golden gates,
And takes her farewell of the glorious sun!
How well resembles it the prime of youth,
Trimm&apos;d like a younker prancing to his love!

[Dazzle mine eyes, or do I see three suns?]

Three glorious suns, each one a perfect sun;
Not separated with the racking clouds,
But sever&apos;d in a pale clear-shining sky.
See, see! they join, embrace, and seem to kiss,
As if they vow&apos;d some league inviolable:
Now are they but one lamp, one light, one sun.
In this the heaven figures some event.</string>

The ruthless queen gave him to dry his cheeks
A napkin steeped in the harmless blood
Of sweet young Rutland, by rough Clifford slain:
And after many scorns, many foul taunts,
They took his head, and on the gates of York
They set the same; and there it doth remain,
The saddest spectacle that e&apos;er I view&apos;d.</string>

		<string>Ten days ago I drown&apos;d these news in tears;
And now, to add more measure to your woes,
I come to tell you things sith then befall&apos;n.
After the bloody fray at Wakefield fought,
Where your brave father breathed his latest gasp,
Tidings, as swiftly as the posts could run,
Were brought me of your loss and his depart.
I, then in London keeper of the king,
Muster&apos;d my soldiers, gather&apos;d flocks of friends,
And very well appointed, as I thought,
March&apos;d toward Saint Alban&apos;s to intercept the queen,
Bearing the king in my behalf along;
For by my scouts I was advertised
That she was coming with a full intent
To dash our late decree in parliament
Touching King Henry&apos;s oath and your succession.
Short tale to make, we at Saint Alban&apos;s met
Our battles join&apos;d, and both sides fiercely fought:
But whether &apos;twas the coldness of the king,
Who look&apos;d full gently on his warlike queen,
That robb&apos;d my soldiers of their heated spleen;
Or whether &apos;twas report of her success;
Or more than common fear of Clifford&apos;s rigour,
Who thunders to his captives blood and death,
I cannot judge: but to conclude with truth,
Their weapons like to lightning came and went;
Our soldiers&apos;, like the night-owl&apos;s lazy flight,
Or like an idle thresher with a flail,
Fell gently down, as if they struck their friends.
I cheer&apos;d them up with justice of our cause,
With promise of high pay and great rewards:
But all in vain; they had no heart to fight,
And we in them no hope to win the day;
So that we fled; the king unto the queen;
Lord George your brother, Norfolk and myself,
In haste, post-haste, are come to join with you:
For in the marches here we heard you were,
Making another head to fight again.</string>

		<string>My gracious liege, this too much lenity
And harmful pity must be laid aside.
To whom do lions cast their gentle looks?
Not to the beast that would usurp their den.
Whose hand is that the forest bear doth lick?
Not his that spoils her young before her face.
Who &apos;scapes the lurking serpent&apos;s mortal sting?
Not he that sets his foot upon her back.
The smallest worm will turn being trodden on,
And doves will peck in safeguard of their brood.
Ambitious York doth level at thy crown,
Thou smiling while he knit his angry brows:
He, but a duke, would have his son a king,
And raise his issue, like a loving sire;
Thou, being a king, blest with a goodly son,
Didst yield consent to disinherit him,
Which argued thee a most unloving father.
Unreasonable creatures feed their young;
And though man&apos;s face be fearful to their eyes,
Yet, in protection of their tender ones,
Who hath not seen them, even with those wings
Which sometime they have used with fearful flight,
Make war with him that climb&apos;d unto their nest,
Offer their own lives in their young&apos;s defence?
For shame, my liege, make them your precedent!
Were it not pity that this goodly boy
Should lose his birthright by his father&apos;s fault,
And long hereafter say unto his child,
&apos;What my great-grandfather and his grandsire got
My careless father fondly gave away&apos;?
Ah, what a shame were this! Look on the boy;
And let his manly face, which promiseth
Successful fortune, steel thy melting heart
To hold thine own and leave thine own with him.</string>

		<string>This battle fares like to the morning&apos;s war,
When dying clouds contend with growing light,
What time the shepherd, blowing of his nails,
Can neither call it perfect day nor night.
Now sways it this way, like a mighty sea
Forced by the tide to combat with the wind;
Now sways it that way, like the selfsame sea
Forced to retire by fury of the wind:
Sometime the flood prevails, and then the wind;
Now one the better, then another best;
Both tugging to be victors, breast to breast,
Yet neither conqueror nor conquered:
So is the equal of this fell war.
Here on this molehill will I sit me down.
To whom God will, there be the victory!
For Margaret my queen, and Clifford too,
Have chid me from the battle; swearing both
They prosper best of all when I am thence.
Would I were dead! if God&apos;s good will were so;
For what is in this world but grief and woe?
O God! methinks it were a happy life,
To be no better than a homely swain;
To sit upon a hill, as I do now,
To carve out dials quaintly, point by point,
Thereby to see the minutes how they run,
How many make the hour full complete;
How many hours bring about the day;
How many days will finish up the year;
How many years a mortal man may live.
When this is known, then to divide the times:
So many hours must I tend my flock;
So many hours must I take my rest;
So many hours must I contemplate;
So many hours must I sport myself;
So many days my ewes have been with young;
So many weeks ere the poor fools will ean:
So many years ere I shall shear the fleece:
So minutes, hours, days, months, and years,
Pass&apos;d over to the end they were created,
Would bring white hairs unto a quiet grave.
Ah, what a life were this! how sweet! how lovely!
Gives not the hawthorn-bush a sweeter shade
To shepherds looking on their silly sheep,
Than doth a rich embroider&apos;d canopy
To kings that fear their subjects&apos; treachery?
O, yes, it doth; a thousand-fold it doth.
And to conclude, the shepherd&apos;s homely curds,
His cold thin drink out of his leather bottle.
His wonted sleep under a fresh tree&apos;s shade,
All which secure and sweetly he enjoys,
Is far beyond a prince&apos;s delicates,
His viands sparkling in a golden cup,
His body couched in a curious bed,
When care, mistrust, and treason waits on him.</string>

Give me thy gold, if thou hast any gold:
For I have bought it with an hundred blows.
But let me see: is this our foeman&apos;s face?
Ah, no, no, no, it is mine only son!
Ah, boy, if any life be left in thee,
Throw up thine eye! see, see what showers arise,
Blown with the windy tempest of my heart,
Upon thy words, that kill mine eye and heart!
O, pity, God, this miserable age!
What stratagems, how fell, how butcherly,
Erroneous, mutinous and unnatural,
This deadly quarrel daily doth beget!
O boy, thy father gave thee life too soon,
And hath bereft thee of thy life too late!</string>

		<string>Here burns my candle out; ay, here it dies,
Which, whiles it lasted, gave King Henry light.
O Lancaster, I fear thy overthrow
More than my body&apos;s parting with my soul!
My love and fear glued many friends to thee;
And, now I fall, thy tough commixture melts.
Impairing Henry, strengthening misproud York,
The common people swarm like summer flies;
And whither fly the gnats but to the sun?
And who shines now but Henry&apos;s enemies?
O Phoebus, hadst thou never given consent
That Phaethon should cheque thy fiery steeds,
Thy burning car never had scorch&apos;d the earth!
And, Henry, hadst thou sway&apos;d as kings should do,
Or as thy father and his father did,
Giving no ground unto the house of York,
They never then had sprung like summer flies;
I and ten thousand in this luckless realm
Had left no mourning widows for our death;
And thou this day hadst kept thy chair in peace.
For what doth cherish weeds but gentle air?
And what makes robbers bold but too much lenity?
Bootless are plaints, and cureless are my wounds;
No way to fly, nor strength to hold out flight:
The foe is merciless, and will not pity;
For at their hands I have deserved no pity.
The air hath got into my deadly wounds,
And much effuse of blood doth make me faint.
Come, York and Richard, Warwick and the rest;
I stabb&apos;d your fathers&apos; bosoms, split my breast.</string>

Fled to Scotland, King Henry considers what he knows: that his wife, the queen, and their son have gone to France to ask for aid; and that Warwick, his enemy has gone to France to ask for the king&apos;s sister to marry the new king, Edward. Considering Warwick&apos;s silver tongue, he has little hope for the queen. </string>

		<string>My queen and son are gone to France for aid;
And, as I hear, the great commanding Warwick
Is thither gone, to crave the French king&apos;s sister
To wife for Edward: if this news be true,
Poor queen and son, your labour is but lost;
For Warwick is a subtle orator,
And Lewis a prince soon won with moving words.
By this account then Margaret may win him;
For she&apos;s a woman to be pitied much:
Her sighs will make a battery in his breast;
Her tears will pierce into a marble heart;
The tiger will be mild whiles she doth mourn;
And Nero will be tainted with remorse,
To hear and see her plaints, her brinish tears.
Ay, but she&apos;s come to beg, Warwick to give;
She, on his left side, craving aid for Henry,
He, on his right, asking a wife for Edward.
She weeps, and says her Henry is deposed;
He smiles, and says his Edward is install&apos;d;
That she, poor wretch, for grief can speak no more;
Whiles Warwick tells his title, smooths the wrong,
Inferreth arguments of mighty strength,
And in conclusion wins the king from her,
With promise of his sister, and what else,
To strengthen and support King Edward&apos;s place.
O Margaret, thus &apos;twill be; and thou, poor soul,
Art then forsaken, as thou went&apos;st forlorn!</string>

		<string>Ay, Edward will use women honourably.
Would he were wasted, marrow, bones and all,
That from his loins no hopeful branch may spring,
To cross me from the golden time I look for!
And yet, between my soul&apos;s desire and me--
The lustful Edward&apos;s title buried--
Is Clarence, Henry, and his son young Edward,
And all the unlook&apos;d for issue of their bodies,
To take their rooms, ere I can place myself:
A cold premeditation for my purpose!
Why, then, I do but dream on sovereignty;
Like one that stands upon a promontory,
And spies a far-off shore where he would tread,
Wishing his foot were equal with his eye,
And chides the sea that sunders him from thence,
Saying, he&apos;ll lade it dry to have his way:
So do I wish the crown, being so far off;
And so I chide the means that keeps me from it;
And so I say, I&apos;ll cut the causes off,
Flattering me with impossibilities.
My eye&apos;s too quick, my heart o&apos;erweens too much,
Unless my hand and strength could equal them.
Well, say there is no kingdom then for Richard;
What other pleasure can the world afford?
I&apos;ll make my heaven in a lady&apos;s lap,
And deck my body in gay ornaments,
And witch sweet ladies with my words and looks.
O miserable thought! and more unlikely
Than to accomplish twenty golden crowns!
Why, love forswore me in my mother&apos;s womb:
And, for I should not deal in her soft laws,
She did corrupt frail nature with some bribe,
To shrink mine arm up like a wither&apos;d shrub;
To make an envious mountain on my back,
Where sits deformity to mock my body;
To shape my legs of an unequal size;
To disproportion me in every part,
Like to a chaos, or an unlick&apos;d bear-whelp
That carries no impression like the dam.
And am I then a man to be beloved?
O monstrous fault, to harbour such a thought!
Then, since this earth affords no joy to me,
But to command, to cheque, to o&apos;erbear such
As are of better person than myself,
I&apos;ll make my heaven to dream upon the crown,
And, whiles I live, to account this world but hell,
Until my mis-shaped trunk that bears this head
Be round impaled with a glorious crown.
And yet I know not how to get the crown,
For many lives stand between me and home:
And I,--like one lost in a thorny wood,
That rends the thorns and is rent with the thorns,
Seeking a way and straying from the way;
Not knowing how to find the open air,
But toiling desperately to find it out,--
Torment myself to catch the English crown:
And from that torment I will free myself,
Or hew my way out with a bloody axe.
Why, I can smile, and murder whiles I smile,
And cry &apos;Content&apos; to that which grieves my heart,
And wet my cheeks with artificial tears,
And frame my face to all occasions.
I&apos;ll drown more sailors than the mermaid shall;
I&apos;ll slay more gazers than the basilisk;
I&apos;ll play the orator as well as Nestor,
Deceive more slily than Ulysses could,
And, like a Sinon, take another Troy.
I can add colours to the chameleon,
Change shapes with Proteus for advantages,
And set the murderous Machiavel to school.
Can I do this, and cannot get a crown?
Tut, were it farther off, I&apos;ll pluck it down.</string>

And by the hope I have of heavenly bliss,
That I am clear from this misdeed of Edward&apos;s,
No more my king, for he dishonours me,
But most himself, if he could see his shame.
Did I forget that by the house of York
My father came untimely to his death?
Did I let pass the abuse done to my niece?
Did I impale him with the regal crown?
Did I put Henry from his native right?
And am I guerdon&apos;d at the last with shame?
Shame on himself! for my desert is honour:
And to repair my honour lost for him,
I here renounce him and return to Henry.
My noble queen, let former grudges pass,
And henceforth I am thy true servitor:
I will revenge his wrong to Lady Bona,
And replant Henry in his former state.</string>

[Taking his red rose out of his hat]

Look here, I throw my infamy at thee
I will not ruinate my father&apos;s house,
Who gave his blood to lime the stones together,
And set up Lancaster. Why, trow&apos;st thou, Warwick,
That Clarence is so harsh, so blunt, unnatural,
To bend the fatal instruments of war
Against his brother and his lawful king?
Perhaps thou wilt object my holy oath:
To keep that oath were more impiety
Than Jephthah&apos;s, when he sacrificed his daughter.
I am so sorry for my trespass made
That, to deserve well at my brother&apos;s hands,
I here proclaim myself thy mortal foe,
With resolution, wheresoe&apos;er I meet thee--
As I will meet thee, if thou stir abroad--
To plague thee for thy foul misleading me.
And so, proud-hearted Warwick, I defy thee,
And to my brother turn my blushing cheeks.
Pardon me, Edward, I will make amends:
And, Richard, do not frown upon my faults,
For I will henceforth be no more unconstant.</string>

And tell me who is victor, York or Warwick?
Why ask I that? my mangled body shows,
My blood, my want of strength, my sick heart shows.
That I must yield my body to the earth
And, by my fall, the conquest to my foe.
Thus yields the cedar to the axe&apos;s edge,
Whose arms gave shelter to the princely eagle,
Under whose shade the ramping lion slept,
Whose top-branch overpeer&apos;d Jove&apos;s spreading tree
And kept low shrubs from winter&apos;s powerful wind.
These eyes, that now are dimm&apos;d with death&apos;s black veil,
Have been as piercing as the mid-day sun,
To search the secret treasons of the world:
The wrinkles in my brows, now filled with blood,
Were liken&apos;d oft to kingly sepulchres;
For who lived king, but I could dig his grave?
And who durst mine when Warwick bent his brow?
Lo, now my glory smear&apos;d in dust and blood!
My parks, my walks, my manors that I had.
Even now forsake me, and of all my lands
Is nothing left me but my body&apos;s length.
Why, what is pomp, rule, reign, but earth and dust?
And, live we how we can, yet die we must.</string>

		<string>Great lords, wise men ne&apos;er sit and wail their loss,
But cheerly seek how to redress their harms.
What though the mast be now blown overboard,
The cable broke, the holding-anchor lost,
And half our sailors swallow&apos;d in the flood?
Yet lives our pilot still. Is&apos;t meet that he
Should leave the helm and like a fearful lad
With tearful eyes add water to the sea
And give more strength to that which hath too much,
Whiles, in his moan, the ship splits on the rock,
Which industry and courage might have saved?
Ah, what a shame! ah, what a fault were this!
Say Warwick was our anchor; what of that?
And Montague our topmost; what of him?
Our slaughter&apos;d friends the tackles; what of these?
Why, is not Oxford here another anchor?
And Somerset another goodly mast?
The friends of France our shrouds and tacklings?
And, though unskilful, why not Ned and I
For once allow&apos;d the skilful pilot&apos;s charge?
We will not from the helm to sit and weep,
But keep our course, though the rough wind say no,
From shelves and rocks that threaten us with wreck.
As good to chide the waves as speak them fair.
And what is Edward but ruthless sea?
What Clarence but a quicksand of deceit?
And Richard but a ragged fatal rock?
All these the enemies to our poor bark.
Say you can swim; alas, &apos;tis but a while!
Tread on the sand; why, there you quickly sink:
Bestride the rock; the tide will wash you off,
Or else you famish; that&apos;s a threefold death.
This speak I, lords, to let you understand,
If case some one of you would fly from us,
That there&apos;s no hoped-for mercy with the brothers
More than with ruthless waves, with sands and rocks.
Why, courage then! what cannot be avoided
&apos;Twere childish weakness to lament or fear.</string>

Sink in the ground? I thought it would have mounted.
See how my sword weeps for the poor king&apos;s death!
O, may such purple tears be alway shed
From those that wish the downfall of our house!
If any spark of life be yet remaining,
Down, down to hell; and say I sent thee thither:

[Stabs him again]

I, that have neither pity, love, nor fear.
Indeed, &apos;tis true that Henry told me of;
For I have often heard my mother say
I came into the world with my legs forward:
Had I not reason, think ye, to make haste,
And seek their ruin that usurp&apos;d our right?
The midwife wonder&apos;d and the women cried
&apos;O, Jesus bless us, he is born with teeth!&apos;
And so I was; which plainly signified
That I should snarl and bite and play the dog.
Then, since the heavens have shaped my body so,
Let hell make crook&apos;d my mind to answer it.
I have no brother, I am like no brother;
And this word &apos;love,&apos; which graybeards call divine,
Be resident in men like one another
And not in me: I am myself alone.
Clarence, beware; thou keep&apos;st me from the light:
But I will sort a pitchy day for thee;
For I will buz abroad such prophecies
That Edward shall be fearful of his life,
And then, to purge his fear, I&apos;ll be thy death.
King Henry and the prince his son are gone:
Clarence, thy turn is next, and then the rest,
Counting myself but bad till I be best.
I&apos;ll throw thy body in another room
And triumph, Henry, in thy day of doom.</string>

		<string>Once more we sit in England&apos;s royal throne,
Re-purchased with the blood of enemies.
What valiant foemen, like to autumn&apos;s corn,
Have we mow&apos;d down, in tops of all their pride!
Three Dukes of Somerset, threefold renown&apos;d
For hardy and undoubted champions;
Two Cliffords, as the father and the son,
And two Northumberlands; two braver men
Ne&apos;er spurr&apos;d their coursers at the trumpet&apos;s sound;
With them, the two brave bears, Warwick and Montague,
That in their chains fetter&apos;d the kingly lion
And made the forest tremble when they roar&apos;d.
Thus have we swept suspicion from our seat
And made our footstool of security.
Come hither, Bess, and let me kiss my boy.
Young Ned, for thee, thine uncles and myself
Have in our armours watch&apos;d the winter&apos;s night,
Went all afoot in summer&apos;s scalding heat,
That thou mightst repossess the crown in peace;
And of our labours thou shalt reap the gain.</string>

Whence honour but of danger wins a scar,

But that my resolution helps me. Milford,
When from the mountain-top Pisanio show&apos;d thee,
Thou wast within a ken: O Jove! I think
Foundations fly the wretched; such, I mean,
Where they should be relieved. Two beggars told me
I could not miss my way: will poor folks lie,
That have afflictions on them, knowing &apos;tis
A punishment or trial? Yes; no wonder,
When rich ones scarce tell true. To lapse in fulness
Is sorer than to lie for need, and falsehood
Is worse in kings than beggars. My dear lord!
Thou art one o&apos; the false ones. Now I think on thee,
My hunger&apos;s gone; but even before, I was
At point to sink for food. But what is this?
Here is a path to&apos;t: &apos;tis some savage hold:
I were best not to call; I dare not call:
yet famine,
Ere clean it o&apos;erthrow nature, makes it valiant,
Plenty and peace breeds cowards: hardness ever
Of hardiness is mother. Ho! who&apos;s here?
If any thing that&apos;s civil, speak; if savage,
Take or lend. Ho! No answer? Then I&apos;ll enter.
Best draw my sword: and if mine enemy
But fear the sword like me, he&apos;ll scarcely look on&apos;t.

Complotted and contrived in this land
Fetch from false Mowbray their first head and spring.
Further I say and further will maintain
Upon his bad life to make all this good,
That he did plot the Duke of Gloucester&apos;s death,
Suggest his soon-believing adversaries,
And consequently, like a traitor coward,
Sluiced out his innocent soul through streams of blood:
Which blood, like sacrificing Abel&apos;s, cries,
Even from the tongueless caverns of the earth,
To me for justice and rough chastisement;
And, by the glorious worth of my descent,
This arm shall do it, or this life be spent.</string>

Three parts of that receipt I had for Calais
Disbursed I duly to his highness&apos; soldiers;

Since last I went to France to fetch his queen:
Now swallow down that lie. For Gloucester&apos;s death,
I slew him not; but to my own disgrace
Neglected my sworn duty in that case.
For you, my noble Lord of Lancaster,
The honourable father to my foe
Once did I lay an ambush for your life,
A trespass that doth vex my grieved soul
But ere I last received the sacrament
I did confess it, and exactly begg&apos;d
Your grace&apos;s pardon, and I hope I had it.
This is my fault: as for the rest appeall&apos;d,
It issues from the rancour of a villain,
A recreant and most degenerate traitor
Which in myself I boldly will defend;
And interchangeably hurl down my gage
Upon this overweening traitor&apos;s foot,
To prove myself a loyal gentleman
Even in the best blood chamber&apos;d in his bosom.
In haste whereof, most heartily I pray
Your highness to assign our trial day.</string>

Edward&apos;s seven sons, whereof thyself art one,

Some of those branches by the Destinies cut;
But Thomas, my dear lord, my life, my Gloucester,
One vial full of Edward&apos;s sacred blood,
One flourishing branch of his most royal root,
Is crack&apos;d, and all the precious liquor spilt,
Is hack&apos;d down, and his summer leaves all faded,
By envy&apos;s hand and murder&apos;s bloody axe.
Ah, Gaunt, his blood was thine! that bed, that womb,
That metal, that self-mould, that fashion&apos;d thee
Made him a man; and though thou livest and breathest,
Yet art thou slain in him: thou dost consent
In some large measure to thy father&apos;s death,
In that thou seest thy wretched brother die,
Who was the model of thy father&apos;s life.
Call it not patience, Gaunt; it is despair:
In suffering thus thy brother to be slaughter&apos;d,
Thou showest the naked pathway to thy life,
Teaching stern murder how to butcher thee:
That which in mean men we intitle patience
Is pale cold cowardice in noble breasts.
What shall I say? to safeguard thine own life,
The best way is to venge my Gloucester&apos;s death.</string>

With all good speed at Plashy visit me.
Alack, and what shall good old York there see
But empty lodgings and unfurnish&apos;d walls,
Unpeopled offices, untrodden stones?
And what hear there for welcome but my groans?
Therefore commend me; let him not come there,
To seek out sorrow that dwells every where.
Desolate, desolate, will I hence and die:

Draws the sweet infant breath of gentle sleep;

With harsh resounding trumpets&apos; dreadful bray,

Might from our quiet confines fright fair peace
And make us wade even in our kindred&apos;s blood,
Therefore, we banish you our territories:
You, cousin Hereford, upon pain of life,
Till twice five summers have enrich&apos;d our fields
Shall not regreet our fair dominions,
But tread the stranger paths of banishment.

Sun that warms you here shall shine on me;
And those his golden beams to you here lent

On hearing King Richard has seized the recently dead John of Gaunt&apos;s possessions, York takes offense, marking it as the last straw in a series of outrageous decisions made by the King; he recounts the memory of his father, who makes King Richard seem much crueler by comparison; and points at that Gaunt&apos;s possessions shoud now pass to his son, Henry Bolingbroke.</string>

		<string>How long shall I be patient? ah, how long
Shall tender duty make me suffer wrong?
Not Gloucester&apos;s death, nor Hereford&apos;s banishment
Not Gaunt&apos;s rebukes, nor England&apos;s private wrongs,
Nor the prevention of poor Bolingbroke
About his marriage, nor my own disgrace,
Have ever made me sour my patient cheek,
Or bend one wrinkle on my sovereign&apos;s face.
I am the last of noble Edward&apos;s sons,
Of whom thy father, Prince of Wales, was first:
In war was never lion raged more fierce,
In peace was never gentle lamb more mild,
Than was that young and princely gentleman.
His face thou hast, for even so look&apos;d he,
Accomplish&apos;d with the number of thy hours;
But when he frown&apos;d, it was against the French
And not against his friends; his noble hand
Did will what he did spend and spent not that
Which his triumphant father&apos;s hand had won;
His hands were guilty of no kindred blood,
But bloody with the enemies of his kin.
O Richard! York is too far gone with grief,
Or else he never would compare between.

[Why, uncle, what&apos;s the matter?]

O my liege,
Pardon me, if you please; if not, I, pleased
Not to be pardon&apos;d, am content withal.
Seek you to seize and gripe into your hands
The royalties and rights of banish&apos;d Hereford?
Is not Gaunt dead, and doth not Hereford live?
Was not Gaunt just, and is not Harry true?
Did not the one deserve to have an heir?
Is not his heir a well-deserving son?
Take Hereford&apos;s rights away, and take from Time
His charters and his customary rights;
Let not to-morrow then ensue to-day;
Be not thyself; for how art thou a king
But by fair sequence and succession?
Now, afore God--God forbid I say true!--
If you do wrongfully seize Hereford&apos;s rights,
Call in the letters patent that he hath
By his attorneys-general to sue
His livery, and deny his offer&apos;d homage,
You pluck a thousand dangers on your head,
You lose a thousand well-disposed hearts
And prick my tender patience, to those thoughts
Which honour and allegiance cannot think.</string>

Pisanio have mapped it truly. How fit his garments
serve me! Why should his mistress, who was made by
him that made the tailor, not be fit too? the

play the workman. I dare speak it to myself--for it
is not vain-glory for a man and his glass to confer
in his own chamber--I mean, the lines of my body are
as well drawn as his; no less young, more strong,
not beneath him in fortunes, beyond him in the
advantage of the time, above him in birth, alike
conversant in general services, and more remarkable
in single oppositions: yet this imperceiverant
thing loves him in my despite. What mortality is!
Posthumus, thy head, which now is growing upon thy
shoulders, shall within this hour be off; thy
mistress enforced; thy garments cut to pieces before
thy face: and all this done, spurn her home to her
father; who may haply be a little angry for my so
rough usage; but my mother, having power of his
testiness, shall turn all into my commendations. My
horse is tied up safe: out, sword, and to a sore

		<string>Each substance of a grief hath twenty shadows,
Which shows like grief itself, but is not so;
For sorrow&apos;s eye, glazed with blinding tears,
Divides one thing entire to many objects;
Like perspectives, which rightly gazed upon
Show nothing but confusion, eyed awry
Distinguish form: so your sweet majesty,
Looking awry upon your lord&apos;s departure,
Find shapes of grief, more than himself, to wail;
Which, look&apos;d on as it is, is nought but shadows
Of what it is not. Then, thrice-gracious queen,
More than your lord&apos;s departure weep not: more&apos;s not seen;
Or if it be, &apos;tis with false sorrow&apos;s eye,
Which for things true weeps things imaginary.</string>

Tut, tut!
Grace me no grace, nor uncle me no uncle:
I am no traitor&apos;s uncle; and that word &apos;grace.&apos;
In an ungracious mouth is but profane.
Why have those banish&apos;d and forbidden legs
Dared once to touch a dust of England&apos;s ground?
But then more &apos;why?&apos; why have they dared to march
So many miles upon her peaceful bosom,
Frighting her pale-faced villages with war
And ostentation of despised arms?
Comest thou because the anointed king is hence?
Why, foolish boy, the king is left behind,
And in my loyal bosom lies his power.
Were I but now the lord of such hot youth
As when brave Gaunt, thy father, and myself
Rescued the Black Prince, that young Mars of men,
From forth the ranks of many thousand French,
O, then how quickly should this arm of mine.
Now prisoner to the palsy, chastise thee
And minister correction to thy fault!</string>

But as I come, I come for Lancaster.
And, noble uncle, I beseech your grace
Look on my wrongs with an indifferent eye:
You are my father, for methinks in you
I see old Gaunt alive; O, then, my father,
Will you permit that I shall stand condemn&apos;d
A wandering vagabond; my rights and royalties
Pluck&apos;d from my arms perforce and given away
To upstart unthrifts? Wherefore was I born?
If that my cousin king be King of England,
It must be granted I am Duke of Lancaster.
You have a son, Aumerle, my noble cousin;
Had you first died, and he been thus trod down,
He should have found his uncle Gaunt a father,
To rouse his wrongs and chase them to the bay.
I am denied to sue my livery here,
And yet my letters-patents give me leave:
My father&apos;s goods are all distrain&apos;d and sold,
And these and all are all amiss employ&apos;d.
What would you have me do? I am a subject,
And I challenge law: attorneys are denied me;
And therefore, personally I lay my claim
To my inheritance of free descent.</string>

With too much urging your pernicious lives,
For &apos;twere no charity; yet, to wash your blood
From off my hands, here in the view of men
I will unfold some causes of your deaths.
You have misled a prince, a royal king,
A happy gentleman in blood and lineaments,
By you unhappied and disfigured clean:
You have in manner with your sinful hours
Made a divorce betwixt his queen and him,
Broke the possession of a royal bed
And stain&apos;d the beauty of a fair queen&apos;s cheeks
With tears drawn from her eyes by your foul wrongs.
Myself, a prince by fortune of my birth,
Near to the king in blood, and near in love
Till you did make him misinterpret me,
Have stoop&apos;d my neck under your injuries,
And sigh&apos;d my English breath in foreign clouds,
Eating the bitter bread of banishment;
Whilst you have fed upon my signories,
Dispark&apos;d my parks and fell&apos;d my forest woods,
From my own windows torn my household coat,
Razed out my imprese, leaving me no sign,
Save men&apos;s opinions and my living blood,
To show the world I am a gentleman.
This and much more, much more than twice all this,
Condemns you to the death. See them deliver&apos;d over
To execution and the hand of death.</string>

And heavy-gaited toads lie in their way,
Doing annoyance to the treacherous feet
Which with usurping steps do trample thee:
Yield stinging nettles to mine enemies;
And when they from thy bosom pluck a flower,
Guard it, I pray thee, with a lurking adder
Whose double tongue may with a mortal touch
Throw death upon thy sovereign&apos;s enemies.
Mock not my senseless conjuration, lords:
This earth shall have a feeling and these stones
Prove armed soldiers, ere her native king
Shall falter under foul rebellion&apos;s arms.</string>

That when the searching eye of heaven is hid,
Behind the globe, that lights the lower world,
Then thieves and robbers range abroad unseen
In murders and in outrage, boldly here;
But when from under this terrestrial ball
He fires the proud tops of the eastern pines
And darts his light through every guilty hole,
Then murders, treasons and detested sins,
The cloak of night being pluck&apos;d from off their backs,
Stand bare and naked, trembling at themselves?
So when this thief, this traitor, Bolingbroke,
Who all this while hath revell&apos;d in the night
Whilst we were wandering with the antipodes,
Shall see us rising in our throne, the east,
His treasons will sit blushing in his face,
Not able to endure the sight of day,
But self-affrighted tremble at his sin.
Not all the water in the rough rude sea
Can wash the balm off from an anointed king;
The breath of worldly men cannot depose
The deputy elected by the Lord:
For every man that Bolingbroke hath press&apos;d
To lift shrewd steel against our golden crown,
God for his Richard hath in heavenly pay
A glorious angel: then, if angels fight,
Weak men must fall, for heaven still guards the right.</string>

How some have been deposed; some slain in war,
Some haunted by the ghosts they have deposed;
Some poison&apos;d by their wives: some sleeping kill&apos;d;
All murder&apos;d: for within the hollow crown
That rounds the mortal temples of a king
Keeps Death his court and there the antic sits,
Scoffing his state and grinning at his pomp,
Allowing him a breath, a little scene,
To monarchize, be fear&apos;d and kill with looks,
Infusing him with self and vain conceit,

Taste grief, need friends: subjected thus,

		<string>Noble lords,
Go to the rude ribs of that ancient castle;
Through brazen trumpet send the breath of parley
Into his ruin&apos;d ears, and thus deliver:

Henry Bolingbroke
On both his knees doth kiss King Richard&apos;s hand
And sends allegiance and true faith of heart
To his most royal person, hither come
Even at his feet to lay my arms and power,
Provided that my banishment repeal&apos;d
And lands restored again be freely granted:
If not, I&apos;ll use the advantage of my power
And lay the summer&apos;s dust with showers of blood
Rain&apos;d from the wounds of slaughter&apos;d Englishmen:
The which, how far off from the mind of Bolingbroke
It is, such crimson tempest should bedrench
The fresh green lap of fair King Richard&apos;s land,
My stooping duty tenderly shall show.

Go, signify as much, while here we march
Upon the grassy carpet of this plain.
Let&apos;s march without the noise of threatening drum,
That from this castle&apos;s tatter&apos;d battlements
Our fair appointments may be well perused.
Methinks King Richard and myself should meet
With no less terror than the elements
Of fire and water, when their thundering shock
At meeting tears the cloudy cheeks of heaven.
Be he the fire, I&apos;ll be the yielding water:
The rage be his, whilst on the earth I rain
My waters; on the earth, and not on him.
March on, and mark King Richard how he looks.</string>

If we be not, show us the hand of God
That hath dismissed us from our stewardship;
For well we know, no hand of blood and bone
Can gripe the sacred handle of our sceptre,
Unless he do profane, steal, or usurp.
And though you think that all, as you have done,
Have torn their souls by turning them from us,
And we are barren and bereft of friends;
Yet know, my master, God omnipotent,
Is mustering in his clouds on our behalf
Armies of pestilence; and they shall strike
Your children yet unborn and unbegot,
That lift your vassal hands against my head
And threat the glory of my precious crown.
Tell Bolingbroke--for yond methinks he stands--
That every stride he makes upon my land
Is dangerous treason: he is come to open
The purple testament of bleeding war;
But ere the crown he looks for live in peace,
Ten thousand bloody crowns of mothers&apos; sons
Shall ill become the flower of England&apos;s face,
Change the complexion of her maid-pale peace
To scarlet indignation and bedew
Her pastures&apos; grass with faithful English blood.</string>

		<string>These flowers are like the pleasures of the world;
This bloody man, the care on&apos;t. I hope I dream;
For so I thought I was a cave-keeper,
And cook to honest creatures: but &apos;tis not so;
&apos;Twas but a bolt of nothing, shot at nothing,
Which the brain makes of fumes: our very eyes
Are sometimes like our judgments, blind. Good faith,
I tremble stiff with fear: but if there be
Yet left in heaven as small a drop of pity
As a wren&apos;s eye, fear&apos;d gods, a part of it!
The dream&apos;s here still: even when I wake, it is
Without me, as within me; not imagined, felt.
A headless man! The garments of Posthumus!
I know the shape of&apos;s leg: this is his hand;
His foot Mercurial; his Martial thigh;
The brawns of Hercules: but his Jovial face
Murder in heaven?--How!--&apos;Tis gone. Pisanio,
All curses madded Hecuba gave the Greeks,
And mine to boot, be darted on thee! Thou,
Conspired with that irregulous devil, Cloten,
Hast here cut off my lord. To write and read
Be henceforth treacherous! Damn&apos;d Pisanio
Hath with his forged letters,--damn&apos;d Pisanio--
From this most bravest vessel of the world
Struck the main-top! O Posthumus! alas,
Where is thy head? where&apos;s that? Ay me!
where&apos;s that?
Pisanio might have kill&apos;d thee at the heart,
And left this head on. How should this be? Pisanio?
&apos;Tis he and Cloten: malice and lucre in them
Have laid this woe here. O, &apos;tis pregnant, pregnant!
The drug he gave me, which he said was precious
And cordial to me, have I not found it
Murderous to the senses? That confirms it home:
This is Pisanio&apos;s deed, and Cloten&apos;s: O!
Give colour to my pale cheek with thy blood,
That we the horrider may seem to those
Which chance to find us: O, my lord, my lord!</string>

The king shall do it: must he be deposed?
The king shall be contented: must he lose
The name of king? o&apos; God&apos;s name, let it go:
I&apos;ll give my jewels for a set of beads,
My gorgeous palace for a hermitage,
My gay apparel for an almsman&apos;s gown,
My figured goblets for a dish of wood,
My sceptre for a palmer&apos;s walking staff,
My subjects for a pair of carved saints
And my large kingdom for a little grave,
A little little grave, an obscure grave;
Or I&apos;ll be buried in the king&apos;s highway,
Some way of common trade, where subjects&apos; feet
May hourly trample on their sovereign&apos;s head;
For on my heart they tread now whilst I live;
And buried once, why not upon my head?
Aumerle, thou weep&apos;st, my tender-hearted cousin!
We&apos;ll make foul weather with despised tears;
Our sighs and they shall lodge the summer corn,
And make a dearth in this revolting land.
Or shall we play the wantons with our woes,
And make some pretty match with shedding tears?
As thus, to drop them still upon one place,
Till they have fretted us a pair of graves
Within the earth; and, therein laid,--there lies
Two kinsmen digg&apos;d their graves with weeping eyes.
Would not this ill do well? Well, well, I see
I talk but idly, and you laugh at me.
Most mighty prince, my Lord Northumberland,
What says King Bolingbroke? will his majesty
Give Richard leave to live till Richard die?
You make a leg, and Bolingbroke says ay.</string>

Marry. God forbid!
Worst in this royal presence may I speak,
Yet best beseeming me to speak the truth.
Would God that any in this noble presence
Were enough noble to be upright judge
Of noble Richard! then true noblesse would
Learn him forbearance from so foul a wrong.
What subject can give sentence on his king?
And who sits here that is not Richard&apos;s subject?
Thieves are not judged but they are by to hear,
Although apparent guilt be seen in them;
And shall the figure of God&apos;s majesty,
His captain, steward, deputy-elect,
Anointed, crowned, planted many years,
Be judged by subject and inferior breath,
And he himself not present? O, forfend it, God,
That in a Christian climate souls refined
Should show so heinous, black, obscene a deed!
I speak to subjects, and a subject speaks,
Stirr&apos;d up by God, thus boldly for his king:
My Lord of Hereford here, whom you call king,
Is a foul traitor to proud Hereford&apos;s king:
And if you crown him, let me prophesy:
The blood of English shall manure the ground,
And future ages groan for this foul act;
Peace shall go sleep with Turks and infidels,
And in this seat of peace tumultuous wars
Shall kin with kin and kind with kind confound;
Disorder, horror, fear and mutiny
Shall here inhabit, and this land be call&apos;d
The field of Golgotha and dead men&apos;s skulls.
O, if you raise this house against this house,
It will the woefullest division prove
That ever fell upon this cursed earth.
Prevent it, resist it, let it not be so,
Lest child, child&apos;s children, cry against you woe!</string>

Ay, no; no, ay; for I must nothing be;

I give this heavy weight from off my head
And this unwieldy sceptre from my hand,
The pride of kingly sway from out my heart;
With mine own tears I wash away my balm,
With mine own hands I give away my crown,
With mine own tongue deny my sacred state,
With mine own breath release all duty&apos;s rites:
All pomp and majesty I do forswear;
My manors, rents, revenues I forego;
My acts, decrees, and statutes I deny:
God pardon all oaths that are broke to me!
God keep all vows unbroke that swear to thee!
Make me, that nothing have, with nothing grieved,
And thou with all pleased, that hast all achieved!
Long mayst thou live in Richard&apos;s seat to sit,
And soon lie Richard in an earthly pit!

And send him many years of sunshine days!

		<string>Then, as I said, the duke, great Bolingbroke,
Mounted upon a hot and fiery steed
Which his aspiring rider seem&apos;d to know,
With slow but stately pace kept on his course,
Whilst all tongues cried &apos;God save thee,
Bolingbroke!&apos;
You would have thought the very windows spake,
So many greedy looks of young and old
Through casements darted their desiring eyes
Upon his visage, and that all the walls
With painted imagery had said at once
&apos;Jesu preserve thee! welcome, Bolingbroke!&apos;
Whilst he, from the one side to the other turning,
Bareheaded, lower than his proud steed&apos;s neck,
Bespake them thus: &apos;I thank you, countrymen:&apos;
And thus still doing, thus he pass&apos;d along.

[Alack, poor Richard! where rode he the whilst?]

As in a theatre, the eyes of men,
After a well-graced actor leaves the stage,
Are idly bent on him that enters next,
Thinking his prattle to be tedious;
Even so, or with much more contempt, men&apos;s eyes
Did scowl on gentle Richard; no man cried &apos;God save him!&apos;
No joyful tongue gave him his welcome home:
But dust was thrown upon his sacred head:
Which with such gentle sorrow he shook off,
His face still combating with tears and smiles,
The badges of his grief and patience,
That had not God, for some strong purpose, steel&apos;d
The hearts of men, they must perforce have melted
And barbarism itself have pitied him.
But heaven hath a hand in these events,
To whose high will we bound our calm contents.
To Bolingbroke are we sworn subjects now,
Whose state and honour I for aye allow.</string>

		<string>I have been studying how I may compare
This prison where I live unto the world:
And for because the world is populous
And here is not a creature but myself,
I cannot do it; yet I&apos;ll hammer it out.
My brain I&apos;ll prove the female to my soul,
My soul the father; and these two beget
A generation of still-breeding thoughts,
And these same thoughts people this little world,
In humours like the people of this world,
For no thought is contented. The better sort,
As thoughts of things divine, are intermix&apos;d
With scruples and do set the word itself
Against the word:
As thus, &apos;Come, little ones,&apos; and then again,
&apos;It is as hard to come as for a camel
To thread the postern of a small needle&apos;s eye.&apos;
Thoughts tending to ambition, they do plot
Unlikely wonders; how these vain weak nails
May tear a passage through the flinty ribs
Of this hard world, my ragged prison walls,
And, for they cannot, die in their own pride.
Thoughts tending to content flatter themselves
That they are not the first of fortune&apos;s slaves,
Nor shall not be the last; like silly beggars
Who sitting in the stocks refuge their shame,
That many have and others must sit there;
And in this thought they find a kind of ease,
Bearing their own misfortunes on the back
Of such as have before endured the like.
Thus play I in one person many people,
And none contented: sometimes am I king;
Then treasons make me wish myself a beggar,
And so I am: then crushing penury
Persuades me I was better when a king;
Then am I king&apos;d again: and by and by
Think that I am unking&apos;d by Bolingbroke,
And straight am nothing: but whate&apos;er I be,
Nor I nor any man that but man is
With nothing shall be pleased, till he be eased
With being nothing. Music do I hear?

[music]

Ha, ha! keep time: how sour sweet music is,
When time is broke and no proportion kept!
So is it in the music of men&apos;s lives.
And here have I the daintiness of ear
To cheque time broke in a disorder&apos;d string;
But for the concord of my state and time
Had not an ear to hear my true time broke.
I wasted time, and now doth time waste me;
For now hath time made me his numbering clock:
My thoughts are minutes; and with sighs they jar
Their watches on unto mine eyes, the outward watch,
Whereto my finger, like a dial&apos;s point,
Is pointing still, in cleansing them from tears.
Now sir, the sound that tells what hour it is
Are clamorous groans, which strike upon my heart,
Which is the bell: so sighs and tears and groans
Show minutes, times, and hours: but my time
Runs posting on in Bolingbroke&apos;s proud joy,
While I stand fooling here, his Jack o&apos; the clock.
This music mads me; let it sound no more;
For though it have holp madmen to their wits,
In me it seems it will make wise men mad.
Yet blessing on his heart that gives it me!
For &apos;tis a sign of love; and love to Richard
Is a strange brooch in this all-hating world.</string>

		<string>Now is the winter of our discontent
Made glorious summer by this sun of York;
And all the clouds that lour&apos;d upon our house
In the deep bosom of the ocean buried.
Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths;
Our bruised arms hung up for monuments;
Our stern alarums changed to merry meetings,
Our dreadful marches to delightful measures.
Grim-visaged war hath smooth&apos;d his wrinkled front;
And now, instead of mounting barded steeds
To fright the souls of fearful adversaries,
He capers nimbly in a lady&apos;s chamber
To the lascivious pleasing of a lute.
But I, that am not shaped for sportive tricks,
Nor made to court an amorous looking-glass;
I, that am rudely stamp&apos;d, and want love&apos;s majesty
To strut before a wanton ambling nymph;
I, that am curtail&apos;d of this fair proportion,
Cheated of feature by dissembling nature,
Deformed, unfinish&apos;d, sent before my time
Into this breathing world, scarce half made up,
And that so lamely and unfashionable
That dogs bark at me as I halt by them;
Why, I, in this weak piping time of peace,
Have no delight to pass away the time,
Unless to spy my shadow in the sun
And descant on mine own deformity:
And therefore, since I cannot prove a lover,
To entertain these fair well-spoken days,
I am determined to prove a villain
And hate the idle pleasures of these days.
Plots have I laid, inductions dangerous,
By drunken prophecies, libels and dreams,
To set my brother Clarence and the king
In deadly hate the one against the other:
And if King Edward be as true and just
As I am subtle, false and treacherous,
This day should Clarence closely be mew&apos;d up,
About a prophecy, which says that &apos;G&apos;
Of Edward&apos;s heirs the murderer shall be.
Dive, thoughts, down to my soul: here
Clarence comes.</string>

Is to become her husband and her father:
The which will I; not all so much for love
As for another secret close intent,
By marrying her which I must reach unto.
But yet I run before my horse to market:

For now they kill me with a living death.
Those eyes of thine from mine have drawn salt tears,
Shamed their aspect with store of childish drops:
These eyes that never shed remorseful tear,

To hear the piteous moan that Rutland made
When black-faced Clifford shook his sword at him;
Nor when thy warlike father, like a child,
Told the sad story of my father&apos;s death,
And twenty times made pause to sob and weep,
That all the standers-by had wet their cheeks
Like trees bedash&apos;d with rain: in that sad time
My manly eyes did scorn an humble tear;
And what these sorrows could not thence exhale,
Thy beauty hath, and made them blind with weeping.
I never sued to friend nor enemy;
My tongue could never learn sweet smoothing word;
But now thy beauty is proposed my fee,
My proud heart sues, and prompts my tongue to speak.

[she looks scornfully at him]

Teach not thy lips such scorn, for they were made
For kissing, lady, not for such contempt.
If thy revengeful heart cannot forgive,
Lo, here I lend thee this sharp-pointed sword;
Which if thou please to hide in this true bosom.
And let the soul forth that adoreth thee,
I lay it naked to the deadly stroke,
And humbly beg the death upon my knee.

[he lays his breast open: she offers at it with his sword]

Nay, do not pause; for I did kill King Henry,
But &apos;twas thy beauty that provoked me.
Nay, now dispatch; &apos;twas I that stabb&apos;d young Edward,
But &apos;twas thy heavenly face that set me on.

[Here she lets fall the sword]

Take up the sword again, or take up me.</string>

		<string>Yea, bloody cloth, I&apos;ll keep thee, for I wish&apos;d
Thou shouldst be colour&apos;d thus. You married ones,
If each of you should take this course, how many
Must murder wives much better than themselves
For wrying but a little! O Pisiano!
Every good servant does not all commands:
No bond but to do just ones. Gods! if you
Should have ta&apos;en vengeance on my faults, I never
Had lived to put on this: so had you saved
The noble Imogen to repent, and struck
Me, wretch more worth your vengeance. But, alack,
You snatch some hence for little faults; that&apos;s love,
To have them fall no more: you some permit
To second ills with ills, each elder worse,
And make them dread it, to the doers&apos; thrift.
But Imogen is your own: do your best wills,
And make me blest to obey! I am brought hither
Among the Italian gentry, and to fight
Against my lady&apos;s kingdom: &apos;tis enough
That, Britain, I have kill&apos;d thy mistress; peace!
I&apos;ll give no wound to thee. Therefore, good heavens,
Hear patiently my purpose: I&apos;ll disrobe me
Of these Italian weeds and suit myself
As does a Briton peasant: so I&apos;ll fight
Against the part I come with; so I&apos;ll die
For thee, O Imogen, even for whom my life
Is every breath a death; and thus, unknown,
Pitied nor hated, to the face of peril
Myself I&apos;ll dedicate. Let me make men know
More valour in me than my habits show.
Gods, put the strength o&apos; the Leonati in me!
To shame the guise o&apos; the world, I will begin
The fashion, less without and more within.</string>

		<string>Was ever woman in this humour woo&apos;d?
Was ever woman in this humour won?
I&apos;ll have her; but I will not keep her long.
What! I, that kill&apos;d her husband and his father,
To take her in her heart&apos;s extremest hate,
With curses in her mouth, tears in her eyes,
The bleeding witness of her hatred by;
Having God, her conscience, and these bars
against me,
And I nothing to back my suit at all,
But the plain devil and dissembling looks,
And yet to win her, all the world to nothing!
Ha!
Hath she forgot already that brave prince,
Edward, her lord, whom I, some three months since,
Stabb&apos;d in my angry mood at Tewksbury?
A sweeter and a lovelier gentleman,
Framed in the prodigality of nature,
Young, valiant, wise, and, no doubt, right royal,
The spacious world cannot again afford
And will she yet debase her eyes on me,
That cropp&apos;d the golden prime of this sweet prince,
And made her widow to a woful bed?
On me, whose all not equals Edward&apos;s moiety?
On me, that halt and am unshapen thus?
My dukedom to a beggarly denier,
I do mistake my person all this while:
Upon my life, she finds, although I cannot,
Myself to be a marvellous proper man.
I&apos;ll be at charges for a looking-glass,
And entertain some score or two of tailors,
To study fashions to adorn my body:
Since I am crept in favour with myself,
Will maintain it with some little cost.
But first I&apos;ll turn yon fellow in his grave;
And then return lamenting to my love.
Shine out, fair sun, till I have bought a glass,
That I may see my shadow as I pass.</string>

		<string>Methoughts that I had broken from the Tower,
And was embark&apos;d to cross to Burgundy;
And, in my company, my brother Gloucester;
Who from my cabin tempted me to walk
Upon the hatches: thence we looked toward England,
And cited up a thousand fearful times,
During the wars of York and Lancaster
That had befall&apos;n us. As we paced along
Upon the giddy footing of the hatches,
Methought that Gloucester stumbled; and, in falling,
Struck me, that thought to stay him, overboard,
Into the tumbling billows of the main.
Lord, Lord! methought, what pain it was to drown!
What dreadful noise of waters in mine ears!
What ugly sights of death within mine eyes!
Methought I saw a thousand fearful wrecks;
Ten thousand men that fishes gnaw&apos;d upon;
Wedges of gold, great anchors, heaps of pearl,
Inestimable stones, unvalued jewels,
All scatter&apos;d in the bottom of the sea:
Some lay in dead men&apos;s skulls; and, in those holes
Where eyes did once inhabit, there were crept,
As &apos;twere in scorn of eyes, reflecting gems,
Which woo&apos;d the slimy bottom of the deep,
And mock&apos;d the dead bones that lay scatter&apos;d by.

[Had you such leisure in the time of death
To gaze upon the secrets of the deep?]

Methought I had; and often did I strive
To yield the ghost: but still the envious flood
Kept in my soul, and would not let it forth
To seek the empty, vast and wandering air;
But smother&apos;d it within my panting bulk,
Which almost burst to belch it in the sea.

[Awaked you not with this sore agony?]

O, no, my dream was lengthen&apos;d after life;
O, then began the tempest to my soul,
Who pass&apos;d, methought, the melancholy flood,
With that grim ferryman which poets write of,
Unto the kingdom of perpetual night.
The first that there did greet my stranger soul,
Was my great father-in-law, renowned Warwick;
Who cried aloud, &apos;What scourge for perjury
Can this dark monarchy afford false Clarence?&apos;
And so he vanish&apos;d: then came wandering by
A shadow like an angel, with bright hair
Dabbled in blood; and he squeak&apos;d out aloud,
&apos;Clarence is come; false, fleeting, perjured Clarence,
That stabb&apos;d me in the field by Tewksbury;
Seize on him, Furies, take him to your torments!&apos;
With that, methoughts, a legion of foul fiends
Environ&apos;d me about, and howled in mine ears
Such hideous cries, that with the very noise
I trembling waked, and for a season after
Could not believe but that I was in hell,
Such terrible impression made the dream.</string>

		<string>Have a tongue to doom my brother&apos;s death,
And shall the same give pardon to a slave?
My brother slew no man; his fault was thought,
And yet his punishment was cruel death.
Who sued to me for him? who, in my rage,
Kneel&apos;d at my feet, and bade me be advised
Who spake of brotherhood? who spake of love?
Who told me how the poor soul did forsake
The mighty Warwick, and did fight for me?
Who told me, in the field by Tewksbury
When Oxford had me down, he rescued me,
And said, &apos;Dear brother, live, and be a king&apos;?
Who told me, when we both lay in the field
Frozen almost to death, how he did lap me
Even in his own garments, and gave himself,
All thin and naked, to the numb cold night?
All this from my remembrance brutish wrath
Sinfully pluck&apos;d, and not a man of you
Had so much grace to put it in my mind.
But when your carters or your waiting-vassals
Have done a drunken slaughter, and defaced
The precious image of our dear Redeemer,
You straight are on your knees for pardon, pardon;
And I unjustly too, must grant it you
But for my brother not a man would speak,
Nor I, ungracious, speak unto myself
For him, poor soul. The proudest of you all
Have been beholding to him in his life;
Yet none of you would once plead for his life.
O God, I fear thy justice will take hold
On me, and you, and mine, and yours for this!
Come, Hastings, help me to my closet.
Oh, poor Clarence!</string>

Which we more hunt for than the grace of God!
Who builds his hopes in air of your good looks,
Lives like a drunken sailor on a mast,
Ready, with every nod, to tumble down

Or bitterly to speak in your reproof.
Best fitteth my degree or your condition
If not to answer, you might haply think
Tongue-tied ambition, not replying, yielded
To bear the golden yoke of sovereignty,
Which fondly you would here impose on me;
If to reprove you for this suit of yours,
So season&apos;d with your faithful love to me.
Then, on the other side, I cheque&apos;d my friends.
Therefore, to speak, and to avoid the first,
And then, in speaking, not to incur the last,
Definitively thus I answer you.
Your love deserves my thanks; but my desert
Unmeritable shuns your high request.
First if all obstacles were cut away,
And that my path were even to the crown,
As my ripe revenue and due by birth
Yet so much is my poverty of spirit,
So mighty and so many my defects,
As I had rather hide me from my greatness,
Being a bark to brook no mighty sea,
Than in my greatness covet to be hid,
And in the vapour of my glory smother&apos;d.
But, God be thank&apos;d, there&apos;s no need of me,
And much I need to help you, if need were;
The royal tree hath left us royal fruit,
Which, mellow&apos;d by the stealing hours of time,
Will well become the seat of majesty,
And make, no doubt, us happy by his reign.
On him I lay what you would lay on me,
The right and fortune of his happy stars;
Which God defend that I should wring from him!</string>

		<string>My lord, this argues conscience in your grace;
But the respects thereof are nice and trivial,
All circumstances well considered.
You say that Edward is your brother&apos;s son:
So say we too, but not by Edward&apos;s wife;
For first he was contract to Lady Lucy--
Your mother lives a witness to that vow--
And afterward by substitute betroth&apos;d
To Bona, sister to the King of France.
These both put by a poor petitioner,
A care-crazed mother of a many children,
A beauty-waning and distressed widow,
Even in the afternoon of her best days,
Made prize and purchase of his lustful eye,
Seduced the pitch and height of all his thoughts
To base declension and loathed bigamy
By her, in his unlawful bed, he got
This Edward, whom our manners term the prince.
More bitterly could I expostulate,
Save that, for reverence to some alive,
I give a sparing limit to my tongue.
Then, good my lord, take to your royal self
This proffer&apos;d benefit of dignity;
If non to bless us and the land withal,
Yet to draw forth your noble ancestry
From the corruption of abusing times,
Unto a lineal true-derived course.</string>

		<string>This is a lord! O noble misery,
To be i&apos; the field, and ask &apos;what news?&apos; of me!
To-day how many would have given their honours
To have saved their carcasses! took heel to do&apos;t,
And yet died too! I, in mine own woe charm&apos;d,
Could not find death where I did hear him groan,
Nor feel him where he struck: being an ugly monster,
&apos;Tis strange he hides him in fresh cups, soft beds,
Sweet words; or hath more ministers than we
That draw his knives i&apos; the war. Well, I will find him
For being now a favourer to the Briton,
No more a Briton, I have resumed again
The part I came in: fight I will no more,
But yield me to the veriest hind that shall
Once touch my shoulder. Great the slaughter is
Here made by the Roman; great the answer be
Britons must take. For me, my ransom&apos;s death;
On either side I come to spend my breath;
Which neither here I&apos;ll keep nor bear again,
But end it by some means for Imogen.</string>

Came to me, as I follow&apos;d Henry&apos;s corse,
When scarce the blood was well wash&apos;d from his hands
Which issued from my other angel husband
And that dead saint which then I weeping follow&apos;d;
O, when, I say, I look&apos;d on Richard&apos;s face,
This was my wish: &apos;Be thou,&apos; quoth I, &apos; accursed,
For making me, so young, so old a widow!
And, when thou wed&apos;st, let sorrow haunt thy bed;
And be thy wife--if any be so mad--
As miserable by the life of thee
As thou hast made me by my dear lord&apos;s death!
Lo, ere I can repeat this curse again,
Even in so short a space, my woman&apos;s heart
Grossly grew captive to his honey words
And proved the subject of my own soul&apos;s curse,
Which ever since hath kept my eyes from rest;
For never yet one hour in his bed
Have I enjoy&apos;d the golden dew of sleep,
But have been waked by his timorous dreams.
Besides, he hates me for my father Warwick;
And will, no doubt, shortly be rid of me.</string>

That ever yet this land was guilty of.
Dighton and Forrest, whom I did suborn
To do this ruthless piece of butchery,
Although they were flesh&apos;d villains, bloody dogs,
Melting with tenderness and kind compassion
Wept like two children in their deaths&apos; sad stories.
&apos;Lo, thus&apos; quoth Dighton, &apos;lay those tender babes:&apos;
&apos;Thus, thus,&apos; quoth Forrest, &apos;girdling one another
Within their innocent alabaster arms:
Their lips were four red roses on a stalk,
Which in their summer beauty kiss&apos;d each other.
A book of prayers on their pillow lay;
Which once,&apos; quoth Forrest, &apos;almost changed my mind;
But O! the devil&apos;--there the villain stopp&apos;d
Whilst Dighton thus told on: &apos;We smothered
The most replenished sweet work of nature,
That from the prime creation e&apos;er she framed.&apos;
Thus both are gone with conscience and remorse;
They could not speak; and so I left them both,
To bring this tidings to the bloody king.
And here he comes.</string>

A hell-hound that doth hunt us all to death:
That dog, that had his teeth before his eyes,
To worry lambs and lap their gentle blood,
That foul defacer of God&apos;s handiwork,
That excellent grand tyrant of the earth,
That reigns in galled eyes of weeping souls,
Thy womb let loose, to chase us to our graves.
O upright, just, and true-disposing God,
How do I thank thee, that this carnal cur
Preys on the issue of his mother&apos;s body,
And makes her pew-fellow with others&apos; moan!

[O Harry&apos;s wife, triumph not in my woes!
God witness with me, I have wept for thine.]

Bear with me; I am hungry for revenge,
And now I cloy me with beholding it.
Thy Edward he is dead, that stabb&apos;d my Edward:
Thy other Edward dead, to quit my Edward;
Young York he is but boot, because both they
Match not the high perfection of my loss:
Thy Clarence he is dead that kill&apos;d my Edward;
And the beholders of this tragic play,
The adulterate Hastings, Rivers, Vaughan, Grey,
Untimely smother&apos;d in their dusky graves.
Richard yet lives, hell&apos;s black intelligencer,
Only reserved their factor, to buy souls
And send them thither: but at hand, at hand,
Ensues his piteous and unpitied end:
Earth gapes, hell burns, fiends roar, saints pray.
To have him suddenly convey&apos;d away.
Cancel his bond of life, dear God, I prey,
That I may live to say, The dog is dead!</string>

		<string>I call&apos;d thee then vain flourish of my fortune;
I call&apos;d thee then poor shadow, painted queen;
The presentation of but what I was;
The flattering index of a direful pageant;
One heaved a-high, to be hurl&apos;d down below;
A mother only mock&apos;d with two sweet babes;
A dream of what thou wert, a breath, a bubble,
A sign of dignity, a garish flag,
To be the aim of every dangerous shot,
A queen in jest, only to fill the scene.
Where is thy husband now? where be thy brothers?
Where are thy children? wherein dost thou, joy?
Who sues to thee and cries &apos;God save the queen&apos;?
Where be the bending peers that flatter&apos;d thee?
Where be the thronging troops that follow&apos;d thee?
Decline all this, and see what now thou art:
For happy wife, a most distressed widow;
For joyful mother, one that wails the name;
For queen, a very caitiff crown&apos;d with care;
For one being sued to, one that humbly sues;
For one that scorn&apos;d at me, now scorn&apos;d of me;
For one being fear&apos;d of all, now fearing one;
For one commanding all, obey&apos;d of none.
Thus hath the course of justice wheel&apos;d about,
And left thee but a very prey to time;
Having no more but thought of what thou wert,
To torture thee the more, being what thou art.
Thou didst usurp my place, and dost thou not
Usurp the just proportion of my sorrow?
Now thy proud neck bears half my burthen&apos;d yoke;
From which even here I slip my weary neck,
And leave the burthen of it all on thee.
Farewell, York&apos;s wife, and queen of sad mischance:
These English woes will make me smile in France.</string>

		<string>Look, what is done cannot be now amended:
Men shall deal unadvisedly sometimes,
Which after hours give leisure to repent.
If I did take the kingdom from your sons,
To make amends, Ill give it to your daughter.
If I have kill&apos;d the issue of your womb,
To quicken your increase, I will beget
Mine issue of your blood upon your daughter
A grandam&apos;s name is little less in love
Than is the doting title of a mother;
They are as children but one step below,
Even of your mettle, of your very blood;
Of an one pain, save for a night of groans
Endured of her, for whom you bid like sorrow.
Your children were vexation to your youth,
But mine shall be a comfort to your age.
The loss you have is but a son being king,
And by that loss your daughter is made queen.
I cannot make you what amends I would,
Therefore accept such kindness as I can.
Dorset your son, that with a fearful soul
Leads discontented steps in foreign soil,
This fair alliance quickly shall call home
To high promotions and great dignity:
The king, that calls your beauteous daughter wife.
Familiarly shall call thy Dorset brother;
Again shall you be mother to a king,
And all the ruins of distressful times
Repair&apos;d with double riches of content.
What! we have many goodly days to see:
The liquid drops of tears that you have shed
Shall come again, transform&apos;d to orient pearl,
Advantaging their loan with interest
Of ten times double gain of happiness.
Go, then my mother, to thy daughter go
Make bold her bashful years with your experience;
Prepare her ears to hear a wooer&apos;s tale
Put in her tender heart the aspiring flame
Of golden sovereignty; acquaint the princess
With the sweet silent hours of marriage joys
And when this arm of mine hath chastised
The petty rebel, dull-brain&apos;d Buckingham,
Bound with triumphant garlands will I come
And lead thy daughter to a conqueror&apos;s bed;
To whom I will retail my conquest won,
And she shall be sole victress, Caesar&apos;s Caesar.</string>

O coward conscience, how dost thou afflict me!
The lights burn blue. It is now dead midnight.
Cold fearful drops stand on my trembling flesh.
What do I fear? myself? there&apos;s none else by:
Richard loves Richard; that is, I am I.
Is there a murderer here? No. Yes, I am:
Then fly. What, from myself? Great reason why:
Lest I revenge. What, myself upon myself?
Alack. I love myself. Wherefore? for any good
That I myself have done unto myself?
O, no! alas, I rather hate myself
For hateful deeds committed by myself!
I am a villain: yet I lie. I am not.
Fool, of thyself speak well: fool, do not flatter.
My conscience hath a thousand several tongues,
And every tongue brings in a several tale,
And every tale condemns me for a villain.
Perjury, perjury, in the high&apos;st degree
Murder, stem murder, in the direst degree;
All several sins, all used in each degree,
Throng to the bar, crying all, Guilty! guilty!
I shall despair. There is no creature loves me;
And if I die, no soul shall pity me:
Nay, wherefore should they, since that I myself
Find in myself no pity to myself?
Methought the souls of all that I had murder&apos;d
Came to my tent; and every one did threat
To-morrow&apos;s vengeance on the head of Richard.</string>

		<string>More than I have said, loving countrymen,
The leisure and enforcement of the time
Forbids to dwell upon: yet remember this,
God and our good cause fight upon our side;
The prayers of holy saints and wronged souls,
Like high-rear&apos;d bulwarks, stand before our faces;
Richard except, those whom we fight against
Had rather have us win than him they follow:
For what is he they follow? truly, gentlemen,
A bloody tyrant and a homicide;
One raised in blood, and one in blood establish&apos;d;
One that made means to come by what he hath,
And slaughter&apos;d those that were the means to help him;
Abase foul stone, made precious by the foil
Of England&apos;s chair, where he is falsely set;
One that hath ever been God&apos;s enemy:
Then, if you fight against God&apos;s enemy,
God will in justice ward you as his soldiers;
If you do sweat to put a tyrant down,
You sleep in peace, the tyrant being slain;
If you do fight against your country&apos;s foes,
Your country&apos;s fat shall pay your pains the hire;
If you do fight in safeguard of your wives,
Your wives shall welcome home the conquerors;
If you do free your children from the sword,
Your children&apos;s children quit it in your age.
Then, in the name of God and all these rights,
Advance your standards, draw your willing swords.
For me, the ransom of my bold attempt
Shall be this cold corpse on the earth&apos;s cold face;
But if I thrive, the gain of my attempt
The least of you shall share his part thereof.
Sound drums and trumpets boldly and cheerfully;
God and Saint George! Richmond and victory!</string>

Remember whom you are to cope withal;
A sort of vagabonds, rascals, and runaways,
A scum of Bretons, and base lackey peasants,
Whom their o&apos;er-cloyed country vomits forth
To desperate ventures and assured destruction.
You sleeping safe, they bring to you unrest;
You having lands, and blest with beauteous wives,
They would restrain the one, distain the other.
And who doth lead them but a paltry fellow,
Long kept in Bretagne at our mother&apos;s cost?
A milk-sop, one that never in his life
Felt so much cold as over shoes in snow?
Let&apos;s whip these stragglers o&apos;er the seas again;
Lash hence these overweening rags of France,
These famish&apos;d beggars, weary of their lives;
Who, but for dreaming on this fond exploit,
For want of means, poor rats, had hang&apos;d themselves:
If we be conquer&apos;d, let men conquer us,
And not these bastard Bretons; whom our fathers
Have in their own land beaten, bobb&apos;d, and thump&apos;d,
And in record, left them the heirs of shame.
Shall these enjoy our lands? lie with our wives?
Ravish our daughters?</string>

The true succeeders of each royal house,
By God&apos;s fair ordinance conjoin together!
And let their heirs, God, if thy will be so.
Enrich the time to come with smooth-faced peace,
With smiling plenty and fair prosperous days!
Abate the edge of traitors, gracious Lord,
That would reduce these bloody days again,
And make poor England weep in streams of blood!
Let them not live to taste this land&apos;s increase
That would with treason wound this fair land&apos;s peace!

The empire of the sea: our slippery people,
Whose love is never link&apos;d to the deserver
Till his deserts are past, begin to throw
Pompey the Great and all his dignities
Upon his son; who, high in name and power,
Higher than both in blood and life, stands up
For the main soldier: whose quality, going on,
The sides o&apos; the world may danger: much is breeding,
Which, like the courser&apos;s hair, hath yet but life,
And not a serpent&apos;s poison. Say, our pleasure,
To such whose place is under us, requires

Amiss to tumble on the bed of Ptolemy;
To give a kingdom for a mirth; to sit
And keep the turn of tippling with a slave;
To reel the streets at noon, and stand the buffet
With knaves that smell of sweat: say this
becomes him,--
As his composure must be rare indeed
Whom these things cannot blemish,--yet must Antony
No way excuse his soils, when we do bear
So great weight in his lightness. If he fill&apos;d
His vacancy with his voluptuousness,
Full surfeits, and the dryness of his bones,
Call on him for&apos;t: but to confound such time,
That drums him from his sport, and speaks as loud
As his own state and ours,--&apos;tis to be chid
As we rate boys, who, being mature in knowledge,
Pawn their experience to their present pleasure,
And so rebel to judgment.</string>

Leave thy lascivious wassails. When thou once
Wast beaten from Modena, where thou slew&apos;st
Hirtius and Pansa, consuls, at thy heel
Did famine follow; whom thou fought&apos;st against,
Though daintily brought up, with patience more
Than savages could suffer: thou didst drink
The stale of horses, and the gilded puddle
Which beasts would cough at: thy palate then did deign
The roughest berry on the rudest hedge;
Yea, like the stag, when snow the pasture sheets,
The barks of trees thou browsed&apos;st; on the Alps
It is reported thou didst eat strange flesh,
Which some did die to look on: and all this--
It wounds thine honour that I speak it now--
Was borne so like a soldier, that thy cheek
So much as lank&apos;d not.</string>

For so he calls me: now I feed myself
With most delicious poison. Think on me,

And wrinkled deep in time? Broad-fronted Caesar,
When thou wast here above the ground, I was
A morsel for a monarch: and great Pompey
Would stand and make his eyes grow in my brow;
There would he anchor his aspect and die
With looking on his life.</string>

The barge she sat in, like a burnish&apos;d throne,
Burn&apos;d on the water: the poop was beaten gold;
Purple the sails, and so perfumed that
The winds were love-sick with them; the oars were silver,
Which to the tune of flutes kept stroke, and made
The water which they beat to follow faster,
As amorous of their strokes. For her own person,
It beggar&apos;d all description: she did lie
In her pavilion--cloth-of-gold of tissue--
O&apos;er-picturing that Venus where we see
The fancy outwork nature: on each side her
Stood pretty dimpled boys, like smiling Cupids,
With divers-colour&apos;d fans, whose wind did seem
To glow the delicate cheeks which they did cool,
And what they undid did.

[O, rare for Antony!]

Her gentlewomen, like the Nereides,
So many mermaids, tended her i&apos; the eyes,
And made their bends adornings: at the helm
A seeming mermaid steers: the silken tackle
Swell with the touches of those flower-soft hands,
That yarely frame the office. From the barge
A strange invisible perfume hits the sense
Of the adjacent wharfs. The city cast
Her people out upon her; and Antony,
Enthroned i&apos; the market-place, did sit alone,
Whistling to the air; which, but for vacancy,
Had gone to gaze on Cleopatra too,
And made a gap in nature.

[Rare Egyptian!]

Upon her landing, Antony sent to her,
Invited her to supper: she replied,
It should be better he became her guest;
Which she entreated: our courteous Antony,
Whom ne&apos;er the word of &apos;No&apos; woman heard speak,
Being barber&apos;d ten times o&apos;er, goes to the feast,
And for his ordinary pays his heart
For what his eyes eat only.</string>

I have done enough; a lower place, note well,
May make too great an act: for learn this, Silius;
Better to leave undone, than by our deed
Acquire too high a fame when him we serve&apos;s away.
Caesar and Antony have ever won
More in their officer than person: Sossius,
One of my place in Syria, his lieutenant,
For quick accumulation of renown,
Which he achieved by the minute, lost his favour.
Who does i&apos; the wars more than his captain can
Becomes his captain&apos;s captain: and ambition,
The soldier&apos;s virtue, rather makes choice of loss,
Than gain which darkens him.
I could do more to do Antonius good,
But &apos;twould offend him; and in his offence
Should my performance perish.</string>

[You have not call&apos;d me so, nor have you cause.]

Why have you stol&apos;n upon us thus! You come not
Like Caesar&apos;s sister: the wife of Antony
Should have an army for an usher, and
The neighs of horse to tell of her approach
Long ere she did appear; the trees by the way
Should have borne men; and expectation fainted,
Longing for what it had not; nay, the dust
Should have ascended to the roof of heaven,
Raised by your populous troops: but you are come
A market-maid to Rome; and have prevented
The ostentation of our love, which, left unshown,
Is often left unloved; we should have met you
By sea and land; supplying every stage
With an augmented greeting.</string>

To run and show their shoulders. Friends, be gone;
I have myself resolved upon a course
Which has no need of you; be gone:
My treasure&apos;s in the harbour, take it. O,
I follow&apos;d that I blush to look upon:
My very hairs do mutiny; for the white
Reprove the brown for rashness, and they them
For fear and doting. Friends, be gone: you shall
Have letters from me to some friends that will
Sweep your way for you. Pray you, look not sad,
Nor make replies of loathness: take the hint
Which my despair proclaims; let that be left
Which leaves itself: to the sea-side straightway:
I will possess you of that ship and treasure.
Leave me, I pray, a little: pray you now:
Nay, do so; for, indeed, I have lost command,
Therefore I pray you: I&apos;ll see you by and by.</string>

Forgive me in thine own particular;

O sun, thy uprise shall I see no more:
Fortune and Antony part here; even here
Do we shake hands. All come to this? The hearts
That spaniel&apos;d me at heels, to whom I gave
Their wishes, do discandy, melt their sweets
On blossoming Caesar; and this pine is bark&apos;d,
That overtopp&apos;d them all. Betray&apos;d I am:
O this false soul of Egypt! this grave charm,--
Whose eye beck&apos;d forth my wars, and call&apos;d them home;
Whose bosom was my crownet, my chief end,--
Like a right gipsy, hath, at fast and loose,
Beguiled me to the very heart of loss.

With ships made cities, condemn myself to lack
The courage of a woman; less noble mind
Than she which by her death our Caesar tells
&apos;I am conqueror of myself.&apos; Thou art sworn, Eros,
That, when the exigent should come, which now
Is come indeed, when I should see behind me
The inevitable prosecution of
Disgrace and horror, that, on my command,
Thou then wouldst kill me: do&apos;t; the time is come:
Thou strikest not me, &apos;tis Caesar thou defeat&apos;st.
Put colour in thy cheek.

[The gods withhold me!
Shall I do that which all the Parthian darts,
Though enemy, lost aim, and could not?]

Eros,
Wouldst thou be window&apos;d in great Rome and see
Thy master thus with pleach&apos;d arms, bending down
His corrigible neck, his face subdued
To penetrative shame, whilst the wheel&apos;d seat
Of fortunate Caesar, drawn before him, branded
His baseness that ensued?

[I would not see&apos;t.]

Come, then; for with a wound I must be cured.
Draw that thy honest sword, which thou hast worn
Most useful for thy country.

[O, sir, pardon me!]

When I did make thee free, sworest thou not then
To do this when I bade thee? Do it at once;
Or thy precedent services are all
But accidents unpurposed. Draw, and come.

[Turn from me, then, that noble countenance,
Wherein the worship of the whole world lies.]

Lo thee!

[My sword is drawn.]

Then let it do at once
The thing why thou hast drawn it.</string>

O, such another sleep, that I might see
But such another man!

[If it might please ye,--]

His face was as the heavens; and therein stuck
A sun and moon, which kept their course,
and lighted
The little O, the earth.

[Most sovereign creature,--]

His legs bestrid the ocean: his rear&apos;d arm
Crested the world: his voice was propertied
As all the tuned spheres, and that to friends;
But when he meant to quail and shake the orb,
He was as rattling thunder. For his bounty,
There was no winter in&apos;t; an autumn &apos;twas
That grew the more by reaping: his delights
Were dolphin-like; they show&apos;d his back above
The element they lived in: in his livery
Walk&apos;d crowns and crownets; realms and islands were
As plates dropp&apos;d from his pocket.

		<string>I pray you, daughter, sing; or express yourself in a
more comfortable sort: if my son were my husband, I
should freelier rejoice in that absence wherein he
won honour than in the embracements of his bed where
he would show most love. When yet he was but
tender-bodied and the only son of my womb, when
youth with comeliness plucked all gaze his way, when
for a day of kings&apos; entreaties a mother should not
sell him an hour from her beholding, I, considering
how honour would become such a person. that it was
no better than picture-like to hang by the wall, if
renown made it not stir, was pleased to let him seek
danger where he was like to find fame. To a cruel
war I sent him; from whence he returned, his brows
bound with oak. I tell thee, daughter, I sprang not
more in joy at first hearing he was a man-child
than now in first seeing he had proved himself a
man.</string>

You shames of Rome! you herd of--Boils and plagues
Plaster you o&apos;er, that you may be abhorr&apos;d
Further than seen and one infect another
Against the wind a mile! You souls of geese,
That bear the shapes of men, how have you run
From slaves that apes would beat! Pluto and hell!
All hurt behind; backs red, and faces pale
With flight and agued fear! Mend and charge home,
Or, by the fires of heaven, I&apos;ll leave the foe
And make my wars on you: look to&apos;t: come on;
If you&apos;ll stand fast, we&apos;ll beat them to their wives,
As they us to our trenches followed.

[Another alarum. The Volsces fly, and MARCIUS follows them to the gates]

Condition!
I would I were a Roman; for I cannot,
Being a Volsce, be that I am. Condition!
What good condition can a treaty find
I&apos; the part that is at mercy? Five times, Marcius,
I have fought with thee: so often hast thou beat me,
And wouldst do so, I think, should we encounter
As often as we eat. By the elements,
If e&apos;er again I meet him beard to beard,
He&apos;s mine, or I am his: mine emulation
Hath not that honour in&apos;t it had; for where
I thought to crush him in an equal force,
True sword to sword, I&apos;ll potch at him some way
Or wrath or craft may get him.

Bolder, though not so subtle. My valour&apos;s poison&apos;d
With only suffering stain by him; for him
Shall fly out of itself: nor sleep nor sanctuary,
Being naked, sick, nor fane nor Capitol,
The prayers of priests nor times of sacrifice,
Embarquements all of fury, shall lift up
Their rotten privilege and custom &apos;gainst
My hate to Marcius: where I find him, were it
At home, upon my brother&apos;s guard, even there,
Against the hospitable canon, would I
Wash my fierce hand in&apos;s heart. Go you to the city;
Learn how &apos;tis held; and what they are that must
Be hostages for Rome.</string>

		<string>I am known to be a humorous patrician, and one that
loves a cup of hot wine with not a drop of allaying
Tiber in&apos;t; said to be something imperfect in
favouring the first complaint; hasty and tinder-like
upon too trivial motion; one that converses more
with the buttock of the night than with the forehead
of the morning: what I think I utter, and spend my
malice in my breath. Meeting two such wealsmen as
you are--I cannot call you Lycurguses--if the drink
you give me touch my palate adversely, I make a
crooked face at it. I can&apos;t say your worships have
delivered the matter well, when I find the ass in
compound with the major part of your syllables: and
though I must be content to bear with those that say
you are reverend grave men, yet they lie deadly that
tell you you have good faces. If you see this in
the map of my microcosm, follows it that I am known
well enough too? what barm can your bisson
conspectuities glean out of this character, if I be
known well enough too?

[Come, sir, come, we know you well enough.]

You know neither me, yourselves nor any thing. You
are ambitious for poor knaves&apos; caps and legs: you
wear out a good wholesome forenoon in hearing a
cause between an orange wife and a fosset-seller;
and then rejourn the controversy of three pence to a
second day of audience. When you are hearing a
matter between party and party, if you chance to be
pinched with the colic, you make faces like
mummers; set up the bloody flag against all
patience; and, in roaring for a chamber-pot,
dismiss the controversy bleeding the more entangled
by your hearing: all the peace you make in their
cause is, calling both the parties knaves. You are
a pair of strange ones.

[Come, come, you are well understood to be a
perfecter giber for the table than a necessary
bencher in the Capitol.]

Our very priests must become mockers, if they shall
encounter such ridiculous subjects as you are. When
you speak best unto the purpose, it is not worth the
wagging of your beards; and your beards deserve not
so honourable a grave as to stuff a botcher&apos;s
cushion, or to be entombed in an ass&apos;s pack-
saddle. Yet you must be saying, Marcius is proud;
who in a cheap estimation, is worth predecessors
since Deucalion, though peradventure some of the
best of &apos;em were hereditary hangmen. God-den to
your worships: more of your conversation would
infect my brain, being the herdsmen of the beastly
plebeians: I will be bold to take my leave of you.</string>

Faith, there had been many great men that have flattered the people, who ne&apos;er loved them; and there be many that they have loved, they know not wherefore: so that, if they love they know not why, they hate upon no better a ground: therefore, for Coriolanus neither to care whether they love or hate him manifests the true knowledge he has in their disposition; and out of his noble carelessness lets them plainly see&apos;t.

[If he did not care whether he had their love or no, he waved indifferently &apos;twixt doing them neither good nor harm: but he seeks their hate with greater devotion than can render it him; and leaves nothing undone that may fully discover him their opposite. Now, to seem to affect the malice and displeasure of the people is as bad as that which he dislikes, to flatter them for their love.]

He hath deserved worthily of his country: and his ascent is not by such easy degrees as those who, having been supple and courteous to the people, bonneted, without any further deed to have them at an into their estimation and report: but he hath so planted his honours in their eyes, and his actions in their hearts, that for their tongues to be silent, and not confess so much, were a kind of ingrateful injury; to report otherwise, were a malice, that, giving itself the lie, would pluck reproof and rebuke from every ear that heard it.</string>

		<string>I shall lack voice: the deeds of Coriolanus
Should not be utter&apos;d feebly. It is held
That valour is the chiefest virtue, and
Most dignifies the haver: if it be,
The man I speak of cannot in the world
Be singly counterpoised. At sixteen years,
When Tarquin made a head for Rome, he fought
Beyond the mark of others: our then dictator,
Whom with all praise I point at, saw him fight,
When with his Amazonian chin he drove
The bristled lips before him: be bestrid
An o&apos;er-press&apos;d Roman and i&apos; the consul&apos;s view
Slew three opposers: Tarquin&apos;s self he met,
And struck him on his knee: in that day&apos;s feats,
When he might act the woman in the scene,
He proved best man i&apos; the field, and for his meed
Was brow-bound with the oak. His pupil age
Man-enter&apos;d thus, he waxed like a sea,
And in the brunt of seventeen battles since
He lurch&apos;d all swords of the garland. For this last,
Before and in Corioli, let me say,
I cannot speak him home: he stopp&apos;d the fliers;
And by his rare example made the coward
Turn terror into sport: as weeds before
A vessel under sail, so men obey&apos;d
And fell below his stem: his sword, death&apos;s stamp,
Where it did mark, it took; from face to foot
He was a thing of blood, whose every motion
Was timed with dying cries: alone he enter&apos;d
The mortal gate of the city, which he painted
With shunless destiny; aidless came off,
And with a sudden reinforcement struck
Corioli like a planet: now all&apos;s his:
When, by and by, the din of war gan pierce
His ready sense; then straight his doubled spirit
Re-quicken&apos;d what in flesh was fatigate,
And to the battle came he; where he did
Run reeking o&apos;er the lives of men, as if
&apos;Twere a perpetual spoil: and till we call&apos;d
Both field and city ours, he never stood
To ease his breast with panting.</string>

The ruin of the state.

[Why, shall the people give
One that speaks thus their voice?]

I&apos;ll give my reasons,
More worthier than their voices. They know the corn
Was not our recompense, resting well assured
That ne&apos;er did service for&apos;t: being press&apos;d to the war,
Even when the navel of the state was touch&apos;d,
They would not thread the gates. This kind of service
Did not deserve corn gratis. Being i&apos; the war
Their mutinies and revolts, wherein they show&apos;d
Most valour, spoke not for them: the accusation
Which they have often made against the senate,
All cause unborn, could never be the motive
Of our so frank donation. Well, what then?
How shall this bisson multitude digest
The senate&apos;s courtesy? Let deeds express
What&apos;s like to be their words: &apos;we did request it;
We are the greater poll, and in true fear
They gave us our demands.&apos; Thus we debase
The nature of our seats and make the rabble
Call our cares fears; which will in time
Break ope the locks o&apos; the senate and bring in
The crows to peck the eagles.

[Come, enough.]

[Enough, with over-measure.]

No, take more:
What may be sworn by, both divine and human,
Seal what I end withal! This double worship,
Where one part does disdain with cause, the other
Insult without all reason, where gentry, title, wisdom,
Cannot conclude but by the yea and no
Of general ignorance,--it must omit
Real necessities, and give way the while
To unstable slightness: purpose so barr&apos;d, it follows,
Nothing is done to purpose. Therefore, beseech you,--
You that will be less fearful than discreet,
That love the fundamental part of state
More than you doubt the change on&apos;t, that prefer
A noble life before a long, and wish
To jump a body with a dangerous physic
That&apos;s sure of death without it, at once pluck out
The multitudinous tongue; let them not lick
The sweet which is their poison: your dishonour
Mangles true judgment and bereaves the state
Of that integrity which should become&apos;t,
Not having the power to do the good it would,
For the in which doth control&apos;t.</string>

		<string>You are too absolute;
Though therein you can never be too noble,
But when extremities speak. I have heard you say,
Honour and policy, like unsever&apos;d friends,
I&apos; the war do grow together: grant that, and tell me,
In peace what each of them by the other lose,
That they combine not there.

[Tush, tush!]
[A good demand.]

If it be honour in your wars to seem
The same you are not, which, for your best ends,
You adopt your policy, how is it less or worse,
That it shall hold companionship in peace
With honour, as in war, since that to both
It stands in like request?

[Why force you this?]

Because that now it lies you on to speak
To the people; not by your own instruction,
Nor by the matter which your heart prompts you,
But with such words that are but rooted in
Your tongue, though but bastards and syllables
Of no allowance to your bosom&apos;s truth.
Now, this no more dishonours you at all
Than to take in a town with gentle words,
Which else would put you to your fortune and
The hazard of much blood.
I would dissemble with my nature where
My fortunes and my friends at stake required
I should do so in honour: I am in this,
Your wife, your son, these senators, the nobles;
And you will rather show our general louts
How you can frown than spend a fawn upon &apos;em,
For the inheritance of their loves and safeguard
Of what that want might ruin.

[Noble lady!
Come, go with us; speak fair: you may salve so,
Not what is dangerous present, but the loss
Of what is past.]

I prithee now, my son,
Go to them, with this bonnet in thy hand;
And thus far having stretch&apos;d it--here be with them--
Thy knee bussing the stones--for in such business
Action is eloquence, and the eyes of the ignorant
More learned than the ears--waving thy head,
Which often, thus, correcting thy stout heart,
Now humble as the ripest mulberry
That will not hold the handling: or say to them,
Thou art their soldier, and being bred in broils
Hast not the soft way which, thou dost confess,
Were fit for thee to use as they to claim,
In asking their good loves, but thou wilt frame
Thyself, forsooth, hereafter theirs, so far
As thou hast power and person.</string>

Bold of your worthiness, we single you

On serious business, craving quick dispatch,
Importunes personal conference with his grace:

		<string>My name is Caius Marcius, who hath done
To thee particularly and to all the Volsces
Great hurt and mischief; thereto witness may
My surname, Coriolanus: the painful service,
The extreme dangers and the drops of blood
Shed for my thankless country are requited
But with that surname; a good memory,
And witness of the malice and displeasure
Which thou shouldst bear me: only that name remains;
The cruelty and envy of the people,
Permitted by our dastard nobles, who
Have all forsook me, hath devour&apos;d the rest;
And suffer&apos;d me by the voice of slaves to be
Whoop&apos;d out of Rome. Now this extremity
Hath brought me to thy hearth; not out of hope--
Mistake me not--to save my life, for if
I had fear&apos;d death, of all the men i&apos; the world
I would have &apos;voided thee, but in mere spite,
To be full quit of those my banishers,
Stand I before thee here. Then if thou hast
A heart of wreak in thee, that wilt revenge
Thine own particular wrongs and stop those maims
Of shame seen through thy country, speed
thee straight,
And make my misery serve thy turn: so use it
That my revengeful services may prove
As benefits to thee, for I will fight
Against my canker&apos;d country with the spleen
Of all the under fiends. But if so be
Thou darest not this and that to prove more fortunes
Thou&apos;rt tired, then, in a word, I also am
Longer to live most weary, and present
My throat to thee and to thy ancient malice;
Which not to cut would show thee but a fool,
Since I have ever follow&apos;d thee with hate,
Drawn tuns of blood out of thy country&apos;s breast,
And cannot live but to thy shame, unless
It be to do thee service.</string>

		<string>O Marcius, Marcius!
Each word thou hast spoke hath weeded from my heart
A root of ancient envy. If Jupiter
Should from yond cloud speak divine things,
And say &apos;Tis true,&apos; I&apos;ld not believe them more
Than thee, all noble Marcius. Let me twine
Mine arms about that body, where against
My grained ash an hundred times hath broke
And scarr&apos;d the moon with splinters: here I clip
The anvil of my sword, and do contest
As hotly and as nobly with thy love
As ever in ambitious strength I did
Contend against thy valour. Know thou first,
I loved the maid I married; never man
Sigh&apos;d truer breath; but that I see thee here,
Thou noble thing! more dances my rapt heart
Than when I first my wedded mistress saw
Bestride my threshold. Why, thou Mars! I tell thee,
We have a power on foot; and I had purpose
Once more to hew thy target from thy brawn,
Or lose mine arm fort: thou hast beat me out
Twelve several times, and I have nightly since
Dreamt of encounters &apos;twixt thyself and me;
We have been down together in my sleep,
Unbuckling helms, fisting each other&apos;s throat,
And waked half dead with nothing. Worthy Marcius,
Had we no quarrel else to Rome, but that
Thou art thence banish&apos;d, we would muster all
From twelve to seventy, and pouring war
Into the bowels of ungrateful Rome,
Like a bold flood o&apos;er-bear. O, come, go in,
And take our friendly senators by the hands;
Who now are here, taking their leaves of me,
Who am prepared against your territories,
Though not for Rome itself.</string>

The senators and patricians love him too:
The tribunes are no soldiers; and their people
Will be as rash in the repeal, as hasty
To expel him thence. I think he&apos;ll be to Rome
As is the osprey to the fish, who takes it
By sovereignty of nature. First he was
A noble servant to them; but he could not
Carry his honours even: whether &apos;twas pride,
Which out of daily fortune ever taints
The happy man; whether defect of judgment,
To fail in the disposing of those chances
Which he was lord of; or whether nature,
Not to be other than one thing, not moving
From the casque to the cushion, but commanding peace
Even with the same austerity and garb
As he controll&apos;d the war; but one of these--
As he hath spices of them all, not all,
For I dare so far free him--made him fear&apos;d,
So hated, and so banish&apos;d: but he has a merit,
To choke it in the utterance. So our virtues
Lie in the interpretation of the time:
And power, unto itself most commendable,
Hath not a tomb so evident as a chair
To extol what it hath done.
One fire drives out one fire; one nail, one nail;
Rights by rights falter, strengths by strengths do fail.
Come, let&apos;s away. When, Caius, Rome is thine,
Thou art poor&apos;st of all; then shortly art thou mine.</string>

If it were so that our request did tend
To save the Romans, thereby to destroy
The Volsces whom you serve, you might condemn us,
As poisonous of your honour: no; our suit
Is that you reconcile them: while the Volsces
May say &apos;This mercy we have show&apos;d;&apos; the Romans,
&apos;This we received;&apos; and each in either side
Give the all-hail to thee and cry &apos;Be blest
For making up this peace!&apos; Thou know&apos;st, great son,
The end of war&apos;s uncertain, but this certain,
That, if thou conquer Rome, the benefit
Which thou shalt thereby reap is such a name,
Whose repetition will be dogg&apos;d with curses;
Whose chronicle thus writ: &apos;The man was noble,
But with his last attempt he wiped it out;
Destroy&apos;d his country, and his name remains
To the ensuing age abhorr&apos;d.&apos; Speak to me, son:
Thou hast affected the fine strains of honour,
To imitate the graces of the gods;
To tear with thunder the wide cheeks o&apos; the air,
And yet to charge thy sulphur with a bolt
That should but rive an oak. Why dost not speak?
Think&apos;st thou it honourable for a noble man
Still to remember wrongs? Daughter, speak you:
He cares not for your weeping. Speak thou, boy:
Perhaps thy childishness will move him more
Than can our reasons. There&apos;s no man in the world
More bound to &apos;s mother; yet here he lets me prate
Like one i&apos; the stocks. Thou hast never in thy life
Show&apos;d thy dear mother any courtesy,
When she, poor hen, fond of no second brood,
Has cluck&apos;d thee to the wars and safely home,
Loaden with honour. Say my request&apos;s unjust,
And spurn me back: but if it be not so,
Thou art not honest; and the gods will plague thee,
That thou restrain&apos;st from me the duty which
To a mother&apos;s part belongs. He turns away:
Down, ladies; let us shame him with our knees.
To his surname Coriolanus &apos;longs more pride
Than pity to our prayers. Down: an end;
This is the last: so we will home to Rome,
And die among our neighbours. Nay, behold &apos;s:
This boy, that cannot tell what he would have
But kneels and holds up bands for fellowship,
Does reason our petition with more strength
Than thou hast to deny &apos;t. Come, let us go:
This fellow had a Volscian to his mother;
His wife is in Corioli and his child
Like him by chance. Yet give us our dispatch:
I am hush&apos;d until our city be a-fire,
And then I&apos;ll speak a little.</string>

Horatio recounts the conflict between the rulers of Denmark nd Norway that led to the conflict that the country is currently in; he assumes that the recent appearance of a ghost in the image of old King Hamlet is an omen of ill tiding, as had appeared in history before.</string>

		<string>That can I;
At least, the whisper goes so. Our last king,
Whose image even but now appear&apos;d to us,
Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,
Thereto prick&apos;d on by a most emulate pride,
Dared to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet--
For so this side of our known world esteem&apos;d him--
Did slay this Fortinbras; who by a seal&apos;d compact,
Well ratified by law and heraldry,
Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands
Which he stood seized of, to the conqueror:
Against the which, a moiety competent
Was gaged by our king; which had return&apos;d
To the inheritance of Fortinbras,
Had he been vanquisher; as, by the same covenant,
And carriage of the article design&apos;d,
His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,
Of unimproved mettle hot and full,
Hath in the skirts of Norway here and there
Shark&apos;d up a list of lawless resolutes,
For food and diet, to some enterprise
That hath a stomach in&apos;t; which is no other--
As it doth well appear unto our state--
But to recover of us, by strong hand
And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands
So by his father lost: and this, I take it,
Is the main motive of our preparations,
The source of this our watch and the chief head
Of this post-haste and romage in the land.

[I think it be no other but e&apos;en so:
Well may it sort that this portentous figure
Comes armed through our watch; so like the king
That was and is the question of these wars.]

A mote it is to trouble the mind&apos;s eye.
In the most high and palmy state of Rome,
A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,
The graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead
Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets:
As stars with trains of fire and dews of blood,
Disasters in the sun; and the moist star
Upon whose influence Neptune&apos;s empire stands
Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse:
And even the like precurse of fierce events,
As harbingers preceding still the fates
And prologue to the omen coming on,
Have heaven and earth together demonstrated
Unto our climatures and countrymen.</string>

		<string>Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother&apos;s death
The memory be green, and that it us befitted
To bear our hearts in grief and our whole kingdom
To be contracted in one brow of woe,
Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature
That we with wisest sorrow think on him,
Together with remembrance of ourselves.
Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen,
The imperial jointress to this warlike state,
Have we, as &apos;twere with a defeated joy,--
With an auspicious and a dropping eye,
With mirth in funeral and with dirge in marriage,
In equal scale weighing delight and dole,--
Taken to wife: nor have we herein barr&apos;d
Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone
With this affair along. For all, our thanks.
Now follows, that you know, young Fortinbras,
Holding a weak supposal of our worth,
Or thinking by our late dear brother&apos;s death
Our state to be disjoint and out of frame,
Colleagued with the dream of his advantage,
He hath not fail&apos;d to pester us with message,
Importing the surrender of those lands
Lost by his father, with all bonds of law,
To our most valiant brother. So much for him.
Now for ourself and for this time of meeting:
Thus much the business is: we have here writ
To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras,--
Who, impotent and bed-rid, scarcely hears
Of this his nephew&apos;s purpose,--to suppress
His further gait herein; in that the levies,
The lists and full proportions, are all made
Out of his subject: and we here dispatch
You, good Cornelius, and you, Voltimand,
For bearers of this greeting to old Norway;
Giving to you no further personal power
To business with the king, more than the scope
Of these delated articles allow.
Farewell, and let your haste commend your duty.</string>

		<string>&apos;Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet,
To give these mourning duties to your father:
But, you must know, your father lost a father;
That father lost, lost his, and the survivor bound
In filial obligation for some term
To do obsequious sorrow: but to persever
In obstinate condolement is a course
Of impious stubbornness; &apos;tis unmanly grief;
It shows a will most incorrect to heaven,
A heart unfortified, a mind impatient,
An understanding simple and unschool&apos;d:
For what we know must be and is as common
As any the most vulgar thing to sense,
Why should we in our peevish opposition
Take it to heart? Fie! &apos;tis a fault to heaven,
A fault against the dead, a fault to nature,
To reason most absurd: whose common theme
Is death of fathers, and who still hath cried,
From the first corse till he that died to-day,
&apos;This must be so.&apos; We pray you, throw to earth
This unprevailing woe, and think of us
As of a father: for let the world take note,
You are the most immediate to our throne;
And with no less nobility of love
Than that which dearest father bears his son,
Do I impart toward you. For your intent
In going back to school in Wittenberg,
It is most retrograde to our desire:
And we beseech you, bend you to remain
Here, in the cheer and comfort of our eye,
Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son.</string>

Possess it merely. That it should come to this!
But two months dead: nay, not so much, not two:
So excellent a king; that was, to this,
Hyperion to a satyr; so loving to my mother
That he might not beteem the winds of heaven
Visit her face too roughly. Heaven and earth!
Must I remember? why, she would hang on him,
As if increase of appetite had grown
By what it fed on: and yet, within a month--
Let me not think on&apos;t--Frailty, thy name is woman!--
A little month, or ere those shoes were old
With which she follow&apos;d my poor father&apos;s body,
Like Niobe, all tears:--why she, even she--
O, God! a beast, that wants discourse of reason,
Would have mourn&apos;d longer--married with my uncle,
My father&apos;s brother, but no more like my father
Than I to Hercules: within a month:
Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears
Had left the flushing in her galled eyes,
She married. O, most wicked speed, to post
With such dexterity to incestuous sheets!
It is not nor it cannot come to good:
But break, my heart; for I must hold my tongue.</string>

And but one meal on every day beside,
The which I hope is not enrolled there;
And then, to sleep but three hours in the night,
And not be seen to wink of all the day.
When I was wont to think no harm all night
And make a dark night too of half the day.

Marcellus and Bernardo, on their watch,
In the dead vast and middle of the night,
Been thus encounter&apos;d. A figure like your father,
Armed at point exactly, cap-a-pe,
Appears before them, and with solemn march
Goes slow and stately by them: thrice he walk&apos;d
By their oppress&apos;d and fear-surprised eyes,
Within his truncheon&apos;s length; whilst they, distilled
Almost to jelly with the act of fear,
Stand dumb and speak not to him. This to me
In dreadful secrecy impart they did;
And I with them the third night kept the watch;
Where, as they had deliver&apos;d, both in time,
Form of the thing, each word made true and good,
The apparition comes: I knew your father;
These hands are not more like.</string>

In thews and bulk, but, as this temple waxes,
The inward service of the mind and soul
Grows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you now,
And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch
The virtue of his will: but you must fear,
His greatness weigh&apos;d, his will is not his own;
For he himself is subject to his birth:
He may not, as unvalued persons do,
Carve for himself; for on his choice depends
The safety and health of this whole state;
And therefore must his choice be circumscribed
Unto the voice and yielding of that body
Whereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you,
It fits your wisdom so far to believe it
As he in his particular act and place
May give his saying deed; which is no further
Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal.
Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain,
If with too credent ear you list his songs,
Or lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open
To his unmaster&apos;d importunity.
Fear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister,
And keep you in the rear of your affection,
Out of the shot and danger of desire.
The chariest maid is prodigal enough,
If she unmask her beauty to the moon:
Virtue itself &apos;scapes not calumnious strokes:
The canker galls the infants of the spring,
Too oft before their buttons be disclosed,
And in the morn and liquid dew of youth
Contagious blastments are most imminent.
Be wary then; best safety lies in fear:
Youth to itself rebels, though none else near.</string>

Nor any unproportioned thought his act.
Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar.
Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,
Grapple them to thy soul with hoops of steel;
But do not dull thy palm with entertainment
Of each new-hatch&apos;d, unfledged comrade. Beware
Of entrance to a quarrel, but being in,
Bear&apos;t that the opposed may beware of thee.
Give every man thy ear, but few thy voice;
Take each man&apos;s censure, but reserve thy judgment.
Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,
But not express&apos;d in fancy; rich, not gaudy;
For the apparel oft proclaims the man,
And they in France of the best rank and station
Are of a most select and generous chief in that.
Neither a borrower nor a lender be;
For loan oft loses both itself and friend,
And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.
This above all: to thine ownself be true,
And it must follow, as the night the day,
Thou canst not then be false to any man.
Farewell: my blessing season this in thee!</string>

Not of that dye which their investments show,
But mere implorators of unholy suits,
Breathing like sanctified and pious bawds,
The better to beguile. This is for all:

[Is it a custom?]

Ay, marry, is&apos;t:
But to my mind, though I am native here

More honour&apos;d in the breach than the observance.
This heavy-headed revel east and west
Makes us traduced and tax&apos;d of other nations:
They clepe us drunkards, and with swinish phrase
Soil our addition; and indeed it takes
From our achievements, though perform&apos;d at height,
The pith and marrow of our attribute.
So, oft it chances in particular men,
That for some vicious mole of nature in them,
As, in their birth--wherein they are not guilty,
Since nature cannot choose his origin--
By the o&apos;ergrowth of some complexion,
Oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason,
Or by some habit that too much o&apos;er-leavens
The form of plausive manners, that these men,
Carrying, I say, the stamp of one defect,
Being nature&apos;s livery, or fortune&apos;s star,--
Their virtues else--be they as pure as grace,
As infinite as man may undergo--
Shall in the general censure take corruption
From that particular fault: the dram of eale
Doth all the noble substance of a doubt
To his own scandal.</string>

Rest, rest, perturbed spirit!
So, gentlemen,
With all my love I do commend me to you:
And what so poor a man as Hamlet is
May do, to express his love and friending to you,

And still your fingers on your lips, I pray.

		<string>Marry, well said; very well said. Look you, sir,
Inquire me first what Danskers are in Paris;
And how, and who, what means, and where they keep,
What company, at what expense; and finding
By this encompassment and drift of question
That they do know my son, come you more nearer
Than your particular demands will touch it:
Take you, as &apos;twere, some distant knowledge of him;
As thus, &apos;I know his father and his friends,
And in part him: &apos; do you mark this, Reynaldo?

[Ay, very well, my lord.]

&apos;And in part him; but&apos; you may say &apos;not well:
But, if&apos;t be he I mean, he&apos;s very wild;
Addicted so and so:&apos; and there put on him
What forgeries you please; marry, none so rank
As may dishonour him; take heed of that;
But, sir, such wanton, wild and usual slips
As are companions noted and most known
To youth and liberty.

[As gaming, my lord.]

Ay, or drinking, fencing, swearing, quarrelling,
Drabbing: you may go so far.

[My lord, that would dishonour him.]

&apos;Faith, no; as you may season it in the charge
You must not put another scandal on him,
That he is open to incontinency;
That&apos;s not my meaning: but breathe his faults so quaintly
That they may seem the taints of liberty,
The flash and outbreak of a fiery mind,
A savageness in unreclaimed blood,
Of general assault.

[But, my good lord,--]

Wherefore should you do this?

[Ay, my lord,
I would know that.]

Marry, sir, here&apos;s my drift;
And I believe, it is a fetch of wit:
You laying these slight sullies on my son,
As &apos;twere a thing a little soil&apos;d i&apos; the working, Mark you,
Your party in converse, him you would sound,
Having ever seen in the prenominate crimes
The youth you breathe of guilty, be assured
He closes with you in this consequence;
&apos;Good sir,&apos; or so, or &apos;friend,&apos; or &apos;gentleman,&apos;
According to the phrase or the addition
Of man and country.

[Very good, my lord.]

And then, sir, does he this--he does--what was I
about to say? By the mass, I was about to say
something: where did I leave?

[At &apos;closes in the consequence,&apos; at &apos;friend or so,&apos;
and &apos;gentleman.&apos;]

At &apos;closes in the consequence,&apos; ay, marry;
He closes thus: &apos;I know the gentleman;
I saw him yesterday, or t&apos; other day,
Or then, or then; with such, or such; and, as you say,
There was a&apos; gaming; there o&apos;ertook in&apos;s rouse;
There falling out at tennis:&apos; or perchance,
&apos;I saw him enter such a house of sale,&apos;
Videlicet, a brothel, or so forth.
See you now;
Your bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth:
And thus do we of wisdom and of reach,
With windlasses and with assays of bias,
By indirections find directions out:
So by my former lecture and advice,
Shall you my son. You have me, have you not?</string>

		<string>My lord, as I was sewing in my closet,
Lord Hamlet, with his doublet all unbraced;
No hat upon his head; his stockings foul&apos;d,
Ungarter&apos;d, and down-gyved to his ancle;
Pale as his shirt; his knees knocking each other;
And with a look so piteous in purport
As if he had been loosed out of hell
To speak of horrors,--he comes before me.

[Mad for thy love?]

My lord, I do not know;
But truly, I do fear it.

[What said he?]

He took me by the wrist and held me hard;
Then goes he to the length of all his arm;
And, with his other hand thus o&apos;er his brow,
He falls to such perusal of my face
As he would draw it. Long stay&apos;d he so;
At last, a little shaking of mine arm
And thrice his head thus waving up and down,
He raised a sigh so piteous and profound
As it did seem to shatter all his bulk
And end his being: that done, he lets me go:
And, with his head over his shoulder turn&apos;d,
He seem&apos;d to find his way without his eyes;
For out o&apos; doors he went without their helps,
And, to the last, bended their light on me.</string>

The need we have to use you did provoke
Our hasty sending. Something have you heard
Of Hamlet&apos;s transformation; so call it,
Sith nor the exterior nor the inward man
Resembles that it was. What it should be,
More than his father&apos;s death, that thus hath put him
So much from the understanding of himself,
I cannot dream of: I entreat you both,
That, being of so young days brought up with him,
And sith so neighbour&apos;d to his youth and havior,
That you vouchsafe your rest here in our court
Some little time: so by your companies
To draw him on to pleasures, and to gather,
So much as from occasion you may glean,
Whether aught, to us unknown, afflicts him thus,
That, open&apos;d, lies within our remedy.</string>

[As of a man faithful and honourable.]

I would fain prove so. But what might you think,
When I had seen this hot love on the wing--
As I perceived it, I must tell you that,
Before my daughter told me--what might you,
Or my dear majesty your queen here, think,
If I had play&apos;d the desk or table-book,
Or given my heart a winking, mute and dumb,
Or look&apos;d upon this love with idle sight;
What might you think? No, I went round to work,
And my young mistress thus I did bespeak:
&apos;Lord Hamlet is a prince, out of thy star;
This must not be:&apos; and then I precepts gave her,
That she should lock herself from his resort,
Admit no messengers, receive no tokens.
Which done, she took the fruits of my advice;
And he, repulsed--a short tale to make--
Fell into a sadness, then into a fast,
Thence to a watch, thence into a weakness,
Thence to a lightness, and, by this declension,
Into the madness wherein now he raves,
And all we mourn for.</string>

to see thee well. Welcome, good friends. O, my old
friend! thy face is valenced since I saw thee last:
comest thou to beard me in Denmark? What, my young
lady and mistress! By&apos;r lady, your ladyship is
nearer to heaven than when I saw you last, by the
altitude of a chopine. Pray God, your voice, like
apiece of uncurrent gold, be not cracked within the

to&apos;t like French falconers, fly at any thing we see:
we&apos;ll have a speech straight: come, give us a taste
of your quality; come, a passionate speech.

[What speech, my lord?]

I heard thee speak me a speech once, but it was
never acted; or, if it was, not above once; for the
play, I remember, pleased not the million; &apos;twas
caviare to the general: but it was--as I received
it, and others, whose judgments in such matters
cried in the top of mine--an excellent play, well
digested in the scenes, set down with as much
modesty as cunning. I remember, one said there
were no sallets in the lines to make the matter
savoury, nor no matter in the phrase that might
indict the author of affectation; but called it an
honest method, as wholesome as sweet, and by very
much more handsome than fine. One speech in it I
chiefly loved: &apos;twas Aeneas&apos; tale to Dido; and
thereabout of it especially, where he speaks of
Priam&apos;s slaughter: if it live in your memory, begin
at this line: let me see, let me see--
&apos;The rugged Pyrrhus, like the Hyrcanian beast,&apos;--
it is not so:--it begins with Pyrrhus:--
&apos;The rugged Pyrrhus, he whose sable arms,
Black as his purpose, did the night resemble
When he lay couched in the ominous horse,
Hath now this dread and black complexion smear&apos;d
With heraldry more dismal; head to foot
Now is he total gules; horridly trick&apos;d
With blood of fathers, mothers, daughters, sons,
Baked and impasted with the parching streets,
That lend a tyrannous and damned light
To their lord&apos;s murder: roasted in wrath and fire,
And thus o&apos;er-sized with coagulate gore,
With eyes like carbuncles, the hellish Pyrrhus
Old grandsire Priam seeks.&apos;
So, proceed you.</string>

		<string>&apos;Anon he finds him
Striking too short at Greeks; his antique sword,
Rebellious to his arm, lies where it falls,
Repugnant to command: unequal match&apos;d,
Pyrrhus at Priam drives; in rage strikes wide;
But with the whiff and wind of his fell sword
The unnerved father falls. Then senseless Ilium,
Seeming to feel this blow, with flaming top
Stoops to his base, and with a hideous crash
Takes prisoner Pyrrhus&apos; ear: for, lo! his sword,
Which was declining on the milky head
Of reverend Priam, seem&apos;d i&apos; the air to stick:
So, as a painted tyrant, Pyrrhus stood,
And like a neutral to his will and matter,
Did nothing.
But, as we often see, against some storm,
A silence in the heavens, the rack stand still,
The bold winds speechless and the orb below
As hush as death, anon the dreadful thunder
Doth rend the region, so, after Pyrrhus&apos; pause,
Aroused vengeance sets him new a-work;
And never did the Cyclops&apos; hammers fall
On Mars&apos;s armour forged for proof eterne
With less remorse than Pyrrhus&apos; bleeding sword
Now falls on Priam.

Hamlet can barely believe how the player&apos;s speech move him so much, when even his own ambitions can&apos;t move him to action. Inspired, he plans to make Claudius watch a play that resembles his murder of Hamlet&apos;s father so he&apos;ll show some visible sign of guilt - which he hopes will move him to action.</string>

		<string>O, what a rogue and peasant slave am I!
Is it not monstrous that this player here,
But in a fiction, in a dream of passion,
Could force his soul so to his own conceit
That from her working all his visage wann&apos;d,
Tears in his eyes, distraction in&apos;s aspect,
A broken voice, and his whole function suiting
With forms to his conceit? and all for nothing!
For Hecuba!
What&apos;s Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba,
That he should weep for her? What would he do,
Had he the motive and the cue for passion
That I have? He would drown the stage with tears
And cleave the general ear with horrid speech,
Make mad the guilty and appal the free,
Confound the ignorant, and amaze indeed
The very faculties of eyes and ears. Yet I,
A dull and muddy-mettled rascal, peak,
Like John-a-dreams, unpregnant of my cause,
And can say nothing; no, not for a king,
Upon whose property and most dear life
A damn&apos;d defeat was made. Am I a coward?
Who calls me villain? breaks my pate across?
Plucks off my beard, and blows it in my face?
Tweaks me by the nose? gives me the lie i&apos; the throat,
As deep as to the lungs? who does me this?
Ha!
&apos;Swounds, I should take it: for it cannot be
But I am pigeon-liver&apos;d and lack gall
To make oppression bitter, or ere this
I should have fatted all the region kites
With this slave&apos;s offal: bloody, bawdy villain!
Remorseless, treacherous, lecherous, kindless villain!
O, vengeance!
Why, what an ass am I! This is most brave,
That I, the son of a dear father murder&apos;d,
Prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell,
Must, like a whore, unpack my heart with words,
And fall a-cursing, like a very drab,
A scullion!
Fie upon&apos;t! foh! About, my brain! I have heard
That guilty creatures sitting at a play
Have by the very cunning of the scene
Been struck so to the soul that presently
They have proclaim&apos;d their malefactions;
For murder, though it have no tongue, will speak
With most miraculous organ. I&apos;ll have these players
Play something like the murder of my father
Before mine uncle: I&apos;ll observe his looks;
I&apos;ll tent him to the quick: if he but blench,
I know my course. The spirit that I have seen
May be the devil: and the devil hath power
To assume a pleasing shape; yea, and perhaps
Out of my weakness and my melancholy,
As he is very potent with such spirits,
Abuses me to damn me: I&apos;ll have grounds
More relative than this: the play &apos;s the thing
Wherein I&apos;ll catch the conscience of the king.</string>

		<string>To be, or not to be: that is the question:
Whether &apos;tis nobler in the mind to suffer
The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,
And by opposing end them? To die: to sleep;
No more; and by a sleep to say we end
The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks
That flesh is heir to, &apos;tis a consummation
Devoutly to be wish&apos;d. To die, to sleep;
To sleep: perchance to dream: ay, there&apos;s the rub;
For in that sleep of death what dreams may come
When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
Must give us pause: there&apos;s the respect
That makes calamity of so long life;
For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,
The oppressor&apos;s wrong, the proud man&apos;s contumely,
The pangs of despised love, the law&apos;s delay,
The insolence of office and the spurns
That patient merit of the unworthy takes,
When he himself might his quietus make
With a bare bodkin? who would fardels bear,
To grunt and sweat under a weary life,
But that the dread of something after death,
The undiscover&apos;d country from whose bourn
No traveller returns, puzzles the will
And makes us rather bear those ills we have
Than fly to others that we know not of?
Thus conscience does make cowards of us all;
And thus the native hue of resolution
Is sicklied o&apos;er with the pale cast of thought,
And enterprises of great pith and moment
With this regard their currents turn awry,
And lose the name of action.--Soft you now!
The fair Ophelia! Nymph, in thy orisons
Be all my sins remember&apos;d.</string>

		<string>Madam, your father here doth intimate
The payment of a hundred thousand crowns;
Being but the one half of an entire sum
Disbursed by my father in his wars.
But say that he or we, as neither have,
Received that sum, yet there remains unpaid
A hundred thousand more; in surety of the which,
One part of Aquitaine is bound to us,
Although not valued to the money&apos;s worth.
If then the king your father will restore
But that one half which is unsatisfied,
We will give up our right in Aquitaine,
And hold fair friendship with his majesty.
But that, it seems, he little purposeth,
For here he doth demand to have repaid
A hundred thousand crowns; and not demands,
On payment of a hundred thousand crowns,
To have his title live in Aquitaine;
Which we much rather had depart withal
And have the money by our father lent
Than Aquitaine so gelded as it is.
Dear Princess, were not his requests so far
From reason&apos;s yielding, your fair self should make
A yielding &apos;gainst some reason in my breast
And go well satisfied to France again.</string>

		<string>Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounced it to
you, trippingly on the tongue: but if you mouth it,
as many of your players do, I had as lief the
town-crier spoke my lines. Nor do not saw the air
too much with your hand, thus, but use all gently;
for in the very torrent, tempest, and, as I may say,
the whirlwind of passion, you must acquire and beget
a temperance that may give it smoothness. O, it
offends me to the soul to hear a robustious
periwig-pated fellow tear a passion to tatters, to
very rags, to split the ears of the groundlings, who
for the most part are capable of nothing but
inexplicable dumbshows and noise: I would have such
a fellow whipped for o&apos;erdoing Termagant; it
out-herods Herod: pray you, avoid it.

[I warrant your honour.]

Be not too tame neither, but let your own discretion
be your tutor: suit the action to the word, the
word to the action; with this special o&apos;erstep not
the modesty of nature: for any thing so overdone is
from the purpose of playing, whose end, both at the
first and now, was and is, to hold, as &apos;twere, the
mirror up to nature; to show virtue her own feature,
scorn her own image, and the very age and body of
the time his form and pressure. Now this overdone,
or come tardy off, though it make the unskilful
laugh, cannot but make the judicious grieve; the
censure of the which one must in your allowance
o&apos;erweigh a whole theatre of others. O, there be
players that I have seen play, and heard others
praise, and that highly, not to speak it profanely,
that, neither having the accent of Christians nor
the gait of Christian, pagan, nor man, have so
strutted and bellowed that I have thought some of
nature&apos;s journeymen had made men and not made them
well, they imitated humanity so abominably.

[I hope we have reformed that indifferently with us,
sir.]

O, reform it altogether. And let those that play
your clowns speak no more than is set down for them;
for there be of them that will themselves laugh, to
set on some quantity of barren spectators to laugh
too; though, in the mean time, some necessary
question of the play be then to be considered:
that&apos;s villanous, and shows a most pitiful ambition
in the fool that uses it. Go, make you ready.</string>

		<string>Horatio, thou art e&apos;en as just a man
As e&apos;er my conversation coped withal.

[O, my dear lord,--]

Nay, do not think I flatter;
For what advancement may I hope from thee
That no revenue hast but thy good spirits,
To feed and clothe thee? Why should the poor be flatter&apos;d?
No, let the candied tongue lick absurd pomp,
And crook the pregnant hinges of the knee
Where thrift may follow fawning. Dost thou hear?
Since my dear soul was mistress of her choice
And could of men distinguish, her election
Hath seal&apos;d thee for herself; for thou hast been
As one, in suffering all, that suffers nothing,
A man that fortune&apos;s buffets and rewards
Hast ta&apos;en with equal thanks: and blest are those
Whose blood and judgment are so well commingled,
That they are not a pipe for fortune&apos;s finger
To sound what stop she please. Give me that man
That is not passion&apos;s slave, and I will wear him
In my heart&apos;s core, ay, in my heart of heart,
As I do thee.--Something too much of this.--
There is a play to-night before the king;
One scene of it comes near the circumstance
Which I have told thee of my father&apos;s death:
I prithee, when thou seest that act afoot,
Even with the very comment of thy soul
Observe mine uncle: if his occulted guilt
Do not itself unkennel in one speech,
It is a damned ghost that we have seen,
And my imaginations are as foul
As Vulcan&apos;s stithy. Give him heedful note;
For I mine eyes will rivet to his face,
And after we will both our judgments join
In censure of his seeming.</string>

		<string>I do believe you think what now you speak;
But what we do determine oft we break.
Purpose is but the slave to memory,
Of violent birth, but poor validity;
Which now, like fruit unripe, sticks on the tree;
But fall, unshaken, when they mellow be.
Most necessary &apos;tis that we forget
To pay ourselves what to ourselves is debt:
What to ourselves in passion we propose,
The passion ending, doth the purpose lose.
The violence of either grief or joy
Their own enactures with themselves destroy:
Where joy most revels, grief doth most lament;
Grief joys, joy grieves, on slender accident.
This world is not for aye, nor &apos;tis not strange
That even our loves should with our fortunes change;
For &apos;tis a question left us yet to prove,
Whether love lead fortune, or else fortune love.
The great man down, you mark his favourite flies;
The poor advanced makes friends of enemies.
And hitherto doth love on fortune tend;
For who not needs shall never lack a friend,
And who in want a hollow friend doth try,
Directly seasons him his enemy.
But, orderly to end where I begun,
Our wills and fates do so contrary run
That our devices still are overthrown;
Our thoughts are ours, their ends none of our own:
So think thou wilt no second husband wed;
But die thy thoughts when thy first lord is dead.</string>

		<string>O, my offence is rank it smells to heaven;
It hath the primal eldest curse upon&apos;t,
A brother&apos;s murder. Pray can I not,
Though inclination be as sharp as will:
My stronger guilt defeats my strong intent;
And, like a man to double business bound,
I stand in pause where I shall first begin,
And both neglect. What if this cursed hand
Were thicker than itself with brother&apos;s blood,
Is there not rain enough in the sweet heavens
To wash it white as snow? Whereto serves mercy
But to confront the visage of offence?
And what&apos;s in prayer but this two-fold force,
To be forestalled ere we come to fall,
Or pardon&apos;d being down? Then I&apos;ll look up;
My fault is past. But, O, what form of prayer
Can serve my turn? &apos;Forgive me my foul murder&apos;?
That cannot be; since I am still possess&apos;d
Of those effects for which I did the murder,
My crown, mine own ambition and my queen.
May one be pardon&apos;d and retain the offence?
In the corrupted currents of this world
Offence&apos;s gilded hand may shove by justice,
And oft &apos;tis seen the wicked prize itself
Buys out the law: but &apos;tis not so above;
There is no shuffling, there the action lies
In his true nature; and we ourselves compell&apos;d,
Even to the teeth and forehead of our faults,
To give in evidence. What then? what rests?
Try what repentance can: what can it not?
Yet what can it when one can not repent?
O wretched state! O bosom black as death!
O limed soul, that, struggling to be free,
Art more engaged! Help, angels! Make assay!
Bow, stubborn knees; and, heart with strings of steel,
Be soft as sinews of the newborn babe!
All may be well.</string>

		<string>Look here, upon this picture, and on this,
The counterfeit presentment of two brothers.
See, what a grace was seated on this brow;
Hyperion&apos;s curls; the front of Jove himself;
An eye like Mars, to threaten and command;
A station like the herald Mercury
New-lighted on a heaven-kissing hill;
A combination and a form indeed,
Where every god did seem to set his seal,
To give the world assurance of a man:
This was your husband. Look you now, what follows:
Here is your husband; like a mildew&apos;d ear,
Blasting his wholesome brother. Have you eyes?
Could you on this fair mountain leave to feed,
And batten on this moor? Ha! have you eyes?
You cannot call it love; for at your age
The hey-day in the blood is tame, it&apos;s humble,
And waits upon the judgment: and what judgment
Would step from this to this? Sense, sure, you have,
Else could you not have motion; but sure, that sense
Is apoplex&apos;d; for madness would not err,
Nor sense to ecstasy was ne&apos;er so thrall&apos;d
But it reserved some quantity of choice,
To serve in such a difference. What devil was&apos;t
That thus hath cozen&apos;d you at hoodman-blind?
Eyes without feeling, feeling without sight,
Ears without hands or eyes, smelling sans all,

O shame! where is thy blush? Rebellious hell,
If thou canst mutine in a matron&apos;s bones,
To flaming youth let virtue be as wax,
And melt in her own fire: proclaim no shame
When the compulsive ardour gives the charge,
Since frost itself as actively doth burn
And reason panders will.</string>

My pulse, as yours, doth temperately keep time,
And makes as healthful music: it is not madness
That I have utter&apos;d: bring me to the test,
And I the matter will re-word; which madness
Would gambol from. Mother, for love of grace,
Lay not that mattering unction to your soul,
That not your trespass, but my madness speaks:
It will but skin and film the ulcerous place,
Whilst rank corruption, mining all within,
Infects unseen. Confess yourself to heaven;
Repent what&apos;s past; avoid what is to come;
And do not spread the compost on the weeds,
To make them ranker. Forgive me this my virtue;
For in the fatness of these pursy times
Virtue itself of vice must pardon beg,
Yea, curb and woo for leave to do him good.

[O Hamlet, thou hast cleft my heart in twain.]

O, throw away the worser part of it,
And live the purer with the other half.
Good night: but go not to mine uncle&apos;s bed;
Assume a virtue, if you have it not.
That monster, custom, who all sense doth eat,
Of habits devil, is angel yet in this,
That to the use of actions fair and good
He likewise gives a frock or livery,
That aptly is put on. Refrain to-night,
And that shall lend a kind of easiness
To the next abstinence: the next more easy;
For use almost can change the stamp of nature,
And either rein the devil, or throw him out
With wondrous potency. Once more, good night:
And when you are desirous to be bless&apos;d,
I&apos;ll blessing beg of you. My pulse, as yours, doth temperately keep time,

On hearing of the advance of Fortinbras&apos; army, Hamlet marvels that so many can take up arms for such a small territory, while he so far has not been able to summon the power to avenge his own father&apos;s death. He declares that his convictions will not waver from now on.</string>

		<string>How all occasions do inform against me,
And spur my dull revenge! What is a man,
If his chief good and market of his time
Be but to sleep and feed? a beast, no more.
Sure, he that made us with such large discourse,
Looking before and after, gave us not
That capability and god-like reason
To fust in us unused. Now, whether it be
Bestial oblivion, or some craven scruple
Of thinking too precisely on the event,
A thought which, quarter&apos;d, hath but one part wisdom
And ever three parts coward, I do not know
Why yet I live to say &apos;This thing&apos;s to do;&apos;
Sith I have cause and will and strength and means
To do&apos;t. Examples gross as earth exhort me:
Witness this army of such mass and charge
Led by a delicate and tender prince,
Whose spirit with divine ambition puff&apos;d
Makes mouths at the invisible event,
Exposing what is mortal and unsure
To all that fortune, death and danger dare,
Even for an egg-shell. Rightly to be great
Is not to stir without great argument,
But greatly to find quarrel in a straw
When honour&apos;s at the stake. How stand I then,
That have a father kill&apos;d, a mother stain&apos;d,
Excitements of my reason and my blood,
And let all sleep? while, to my shame, I see
The imminent death of twenty thousand men,
That, for a fantasy and trick of fame,
Go to their graves like beds, fight for a plot
Whereon the numbers cannot try the cause,
Which is not tomb enough and continent
To hide the slain? O, from this time forth,
My thoughts be bloody, or be nothing worth!</string>

All from her father&apos;s death. O Gertrude, Gertrude,
When sorrows come, they come not single spies
But in battalions. First, her father slain:
Next, your son gone; and he most violent author
Of his own just remove: the people muddied,
Thick and unwholesome in their thoughts and whispers,
For good Polonius&apos; death; and we have done but greenly,
In hugger-mugger to inter him: poor Ophelia
Divided from herself and her fair judgment,
Without the which we are pictures, or mere beasts:
Last, and as much containing as all these,
Her brother is in secret come from France;
Feeds on his wonder, keeps himself in clouds,
And wants not buzzers to infect his ear
With pestilent speeches of his father&apos;s death;
Wherein necessity, of matter beggar&apos;d,
Will nothing stick our person to arraign
In ear and ear. O my dear Gertrude, this,
Like to a murdering-piece, in many places
Gives me superfluous death.</string>

Of trotting &apos;paritors:--O my little heart:--
And I to be a corporal of his field, 
And wear his colours like a tumbler&apos;s hoop!
What, I! I love! I sue! I seek a wife!
A woman, that is like a German clock,
Still a-repairing, ever out of frame,
And never going aright, being a watch, 
But being watch&apos;d that it may still go right!
Nay, to be perjured, which is worst of all;
And, among three, to love the worst of all;
A wightly wanton with a velvet brow,
With two pitch-balls stuck in her face for eyes; 
Ay, and by heaven, one that will do the deed
Though Argus were her eunuch and her guard:
And I to sigh for her! to watch for her!
To pray for her! Go to; it is a plague
That Cupid will impose for my neglect 
Of his almighty dreadful little might.
Well, I will love, write, sigh, pray, sue and groan:
Some men must love my lady and some Joan.</string>

		<string>Laertes, was your father dear to you?
Or are you like the painting of a sorrow,
A face without a heart?

[Why ask you this?]

Not that I think you did not love your father;
But that I know love is begun by time;
And that I see, in passages of proof,
Time qualifies the spark and fire of it.
There lives within the very flame of love
A kind of wick or snuff that will abate it;
And nothing is at a like goodness still;
For goodness, growing to a plurisy,
Dies in his own too much: that we would do
We should do when we would; for this &apos;would&apos; changes
And hath abatements and delays as many
As there are tongues, are hands, are accidents;
And then this &apos;should&apos; is like a spendthrift sigh,
That hurts by easing. But, to the quick o&apos; the ulcer:--
Hamlet comes back: what would you undertake,
To show yourself your father&apos;s son in deed
More than in words?</string>

That liberal shepherds give a grosser name,

There, on the pendent boughs her coronet weeds
Clambering to hang, an envious sliver broke;
When down her weedy trophies and herself
Fell in the weeping brook. Her clothes spread wide;
And, mermaid-like, awhile they bore her up:
Which time she chanted snatches of old tunes;
As one incapable of her own distress,
Or like a creature native and indued
Unto that element: but long it could not be
Till that her garments, heavy with their drink,
Pull&apos;d the poor wretch from her melodious lay
To muddy death.</string>

Then Hamlet does it not, Hamlet denies it.
Who does it, then? His madness: if&apos;t be so,
Hamlet is of the faction that is wrong&apos;d;
His madness is poor Hamlet&apos;s enemy.

		<string>Wherefore rejoice? What conquest brings he home?
What tributaries follow him to Rome,
To grace in captive bonds his chariot-wheels?
You blocks, you stones, you worse than senseless things!
O you hard hearts, you cruel men of Rome,
Knew you not Pompey? Many a time and oft
Have you climb&apos;d up to walls and battlements,
To towers and windows, yea, to chimney-tops,
Your infants in your arms, and there have sat
The livelong day, with patient expectation,
To see great Pompey pass the streets of Rome:
And when you saw his chariot but appear,
Have you not made an universal shout,
That Tiber trembled underneath her banks,
To hear the replication of your sounds
Made in her concave shores?
And do you now put on your best attire?
And do you now cull out a holiday?
And do you now strew flowers in his way
That comes in triumph over Pompey&apos;s blood? Be gone!
Run to your houses, fall upon your knees,
Pray to the gods to intermit the plague
That needs must light on this ingratitude.</string>

And since you know you cannot see yourself
So well as by reflection, I, your glass,
Will modestly discover to yourself
That of yourself which you yet know not of.
And be not jealous on me, gentle Brutus:
Were I a common laugher, or did use
To stale with ordinary oaths my love
To every new protester; if you know
That I do fawn on men and hug them hard
And after scandal them, or if you know
That I profess myself in banqueting
To all the rout, then hold me dangerous.</string>

		<string>I know that virtue to be in you, Brutus,
As well as I do know your outward favour.
Well, honour is the subject of my story.
I cannot tell what you and other men
Think of this life; but, for my single self,
I had as lief not be as live to be
In awe of such a thing as I myself.
I was born free as Caesar; so were you:
We both have fed as well, and we can both
Endure the winter&apos;s cold as well as he:
For once, upon a raw and gusty day,
The troubled Tiber chafing with her shores,
Caesar said to me &apos;Darest thou, Cassius, now
Leap in with me into this angry flood,
And swim to yonder point?&apos; Upon the word,
Accoutred as I was, I plunged in
And bade him follow; so indeed he did.
The torrent roar&apos;d, and we did buffet it
With lusty sinews, throwing it aside
And stemming it with hearts of controversy;
But ere we could arrive the point proposed,
Caesar cried &apos;Help me, Cassius, or I sink!&apos;
I, as Aeneas, our great ancestor,
Did from the flames of Troy upon his shoulder
The old Anchises bear, so from the waves of Tiber
Did I the tired Caesar. And this man
Is now become a god, and Cassius is
A wretched creature and must bend his body,
If Caesar carelessly but nod on him.
He had a fever when he was in Spain,
And when the fit was on him, I did mark
How he did shake: &apos;tis true, this god did shake;
His coward lips did from their colour fly,
And that same eye whose bend doth awe the world
Did lose his lustre: I did hear him groan:
Ay, and that tongue of his that bade the Romans
Mark him and write his speeches in their books,
Alas, it cried &apos;Give me some drink, Titinius,&apos;
As a sick girl. Ye gods, it doth amaze me
A man of such a feeble temper should
So get the start of the majestic world
And bear the palm alone.</string>

Like a Colossus, and we petty men
Walk under his huge legs and peep about
To find ourselves dishonourable graves.
Men at some time are masters of their fates:
The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars,
But in ourselves, that we are underlings.
Brutus and Caesar: what should be in that &apos;Caesar&apos;?
Why should that name be sounded more than yours?
Write them together, yours is as fair a name;
Sound them, it doth become the mouth as well;
Weigh them, it is as heavy; conjure with &apos;em,
Brutus will start a spirit as soon as Caesar.
Now, in the names of all the gods at once,
Upon what meat doth this our Caesar feed,
That he is grown so great? Age, thou art shamed!
Rome, thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods!
When went there by an age, since the great flood,
But it was famed with more than with one man?
When could they say till now, that talk&apos;d of Rome,
That her wide walls encompass&apos;d but one man?
Now is it Rome indeed and room enough,
When there is in it but one only man.
O, you and I have heard our fathers say,
There was a Brutus once that would have brook&apos;d
The eternal devil to keep his state in Rome
As easily as a king.</string>

		<string>Let me have men about me that are fat;
Sleek-headed men and such as sleep o&apos; nights:
Yond Cassius has a lean and hungry look;
He thinks too much: such men are dangerous.

[Fear him not, Caesar; he&apos;s not dangerous;
He is a noble Roman and well given.]

Would he were fatter! But I fear him not:
Yet if my name were liable to fear,
I do not know the man I should avoid
So soon as that spare Cassius. He reads much;
He is a great observer and he looks
Quite through the deeds of men: he loves no plays,
As thou dost, Antony; he hears no music;
Seldom he smiles, and smiles in such a sort
As if he mock&apos;d himself and scorn&apos;d his spirit
That could be moved to smile at any thing.
Such men as he be never at heart&apos;s ease
Whiles they behold a greater than themselves,
And therefore are they very dangerous.
I rather tell thee what is to be fear&apos;d
Than what I fear; for always I am Caesar.
Come on my right hand, for this ear is deaf,
And tell me truly what thou think&apos;st of him.</string>

I saw Mark Antony offer him a crown;--yet &apos;twas not a crown neither, &apos;twas one of these coronets;--and, as I told you, he put it by once: but, for all that, to my thinking, he would fain have had it. Then he offered it to him again; then he put it by again: but, to my thinking, he was very loath to lay his fingers off it. And then he offered it the third time; he put it the third time by: and still as he refused it, the rabblement hooted and clapped their chapped hands and threw up their sweaty night-caps and uttered such a deal of stinking breath because Caesar refused the crown that it had almost choked Caesar; for he swounded and fell down at it: and for mine own part, I durst not laugh, for fear of opening my lips and receiving the bad air.</string>

		<string>Are not you moved, when all the sway of earth
Shakes like a thing unfirm? O Cicero,
I have seen tempests, when the scolding winds
Have rived the knotty oaks, and I have seen
The ambitious ocean swell and rage and foam,
To be exalted with the threatening clouds:
But never till to-night, never till now,
Did I go through a tempest dropping fire.
Either there is a civil strife in heaven,
Or else the world, too saucy with the gods,
Incenses them to send destruction.

[Why, saw you any thing more wonderful?]

A common slave--you know him well by sight--
Held up his left hand, which did flame and burn
Like twenty torches join&apos;d, and yet his hand,
Not sensible of fire, remain&apos;d unscorch&apos;d.
Besides--I ha&apos; not since put up my sword--
Against the Capitol I met a lion,
Who glared upon me, and went surly by,
Without annoying me: and there were drawn
Upon a heap a hundred ghastly women,
Transformed with their fear; who swore they saw
Men all in fire walk up and down the streets.
And yesterday the bird of night did sit
Even at noon-day upon the market-place,
Hooting and shrieking. When these prodigies
Do so conjointly meet, let not men say
&apos;These are their reasons; they are natural;&apos;
For, I believe, they are portentous things
Unto the climate that they point upon.</string>

That should be in a Roman you do want,
Or else you use not. You look pale and gaze
And put on fear and cast yourself in wonder,
To see the strange impatience of the heavens:

Why all these fires, why all these gliding ghosts,
Why birds and beasts from quality and kind,
Why old men fool and children calculate,
Why all these things change from their ordinance
Their natures and preformed faculties
To monstrous quality,--why, you shall find
That heaven hath infused them with these spirits,
To make them instruments of fear and warning
Unto some monstrous state.
Now could I, Casca, name to thee a man
Most like this dreadful night,
That thunders, lightens, opens graves, and roars
As doth the lion in the Capitol,
A man no mightier than thyself or me
In personal action, yet prodigious grown
And fearful, as these strange eruptions are.</string>

Cassius from bondage will deliver Cassius:
Therein, ye gods, you make the weak most strong;
Therein, ye gods, you tyrants do defeat:
Nor stony tower, nor walls of beaten brass,
Nor airless dungeon, nor strong links of iron,
Can be retentive to the strength of spirit;
But life, being weary of these worldly bars,
Never lacks power to dismiss itself.
If I know this, know all the world besides,
That part of tyranny that I do bear
I can shake off at pleasure.

[So can I:
So every bondman in his own hand bears
The power to cancel his captivity.]

And why should Caesar be a tyrant then?
Poor man! I know he would not be a wolf,
But that he sees the Romans are but sheep:
He were no lion, were not Romans hinds.
Those that with haste will make a mighty fire
Begin it with weak straws: what trash is Rome,
What rubbish and what offal, when it serves
For the base matter to illuminate
So vile a thing as Caesar! But, O grief,
Where hast thou led me? I perhaps speak this
Before a willing bondman; then I know
My answer must be made. But I am arm&apos;d,
And dangers are to me indifferent.</string>

		<string>It must be by his death: and for my part,
I know no personal cause to spurn at him,
But for the general. He would be crown&apos;d:
How that might change his nature, there&apos;s the question.
It is the bright day that brings forth the adder;
And that craves wary walking. Crown him?--that;--
And then, I grant, we put a sting in him,
That at his will he may do danger with.
The abuse of greatness is, when it disjoins
Remorse from power: and, to speak truth of Caesar,
I have not known when his affections sway&apos;d
More than his reason. But &apos;tis a common proof,
That lowliness is young ambition&apos;s ladder,
Whereto the climber-upward turns his face;
But when he once attains the upmost round.
He then unto the ladder turns his back,
Looks in the clouds, scorning the base degrees
By which he did ascend. So Caesar may.
Then, lest he may, prevent. And, since the quarrel
Will bear no colour for the thing he is,
Fashion it thus; that what he is, augmented,
Would run to these and these extremities:
And therefore think him as a serpent&apos;s egg
Which, hatch&apos;d, would, as his kind, grow mischievous,
And kill him in the shell.</string>

&apos;Brutus, thou sleep&apos;st: awake, and see thyself.
Shall Rome, &amp; c. Speak, strike, redress!
Brutus, thou sleep&apos;st: awake!&apos;
Such instigations have been often dropp&apos;d
Where I have took them up.
&apos;Shall Rome, &amp; c.&apos; Thus must I piece it out:
Shall Rome stand under one man&apos;s awe? What, Rome?
My ancestors did from the streets of Rome
The Tarquin drive, when he was call&apos;d a king.
&apos;Speak, strike, redress!&apos; Am I entreated
To speak and strike? O Rome, I make thee promise:
If the redress will follow, thou receivest
Thy full petition at the hand of Brutus!</string>

		<string>No, not an oath: if not the face of men,
The sufferance of our souls, the time&apos;s abuse,--
If these be motives weak, break off betimes,
And every man hence to his idle bed;
So let high-sighted tyranny range on,
Till each man drop by lottery. But if these,
As I am sure they do, bear fire enough
To kindle cowards and to steel with valour
The melting spirits of women, then, countrymen,
What need we any spur but our own cause,
To prick us to redress? what other bond
Than secret Romans, that have spoke the word,
And will not palter? and what other oath
Than honesty to honesty engaged,
That this shall be, or we will fall for it?
Swear priests and cowards and men cautelous,
Old feeble carrions and such suffering souls
That welcome wrongs; unto bad causes swear
Such creatures as men doubt; but do not stain
The even virtue of our enterprise,
Nor the insuppressive mettle of our spirits,
To think that or our cause or our performance
Did need an oath; when every drop of blood
That every Roman bears, and nobly bears,
Is guilty of a several bastardy,
If he do break the smallest particle
Of any promise that hath pass&apos;d from him.</string>

		<string>Our course will seem too bloody, Caius Cassius,
To cut the head off and then hack the limbs,
Like wrath in death and envy afterwards;
For Antony is but a limb of Caesar:
Let us be sacrificers, but not butchers, Caius.
We all stand up against the spirit of Caesar;
And in the spirit of men there is no blood:
O, that we then could come by Caesar&apos;s spirit,
And not dismember Caesar! But, alas,
Caesar must bleed for it! And, gentle friends,
Let&apos;s kill him boldly, but not wrathfully;
Let&apos;s carve him as a dish fit for the gods,
Not hew him as a carcass fit for hounds:
And let our hearts, as subtle masters do,
Stir up their servants to an act of rage,
And after seem to chide &apos;em. This shall make
Our purpose necessary and not envious:
Which so appearing to the common eyes,
We shall be call&apos;d purgers, not murderers.
And for Mark Antony, think not of him;
For he can do no more than Caesar&apos;s arm
When Caesar&apos;s head is off.</string>

		<string>You&apos;ve ungently, Brutus,
Stole from my bed: and yesternight, at supper,
You suddenly arose, and walk&apos;d about,
Musing and sighing, with your arms across,
And when I ask&apos;d you what the matter was,
You stared upon me with ungentle looks;
I urged you further; then you scratch&apos;d your head,
And too impatiently stamp&apos;d with your foot;
Yet I insisted, yet you answer&apos;d not,
But, with an angry wafture of your hand,
Gave sign for me to leave you: so I did;
Fearing to strengthen that impatience
Which seem&apos;d too much enkindled, and withal
Hoping it was but an effect of humour,
Which sometime hath his hour with every man.
It will not let you eat, nor talk, nor sleep,
And could it work so much upon your shape
As it hath much prevail&apos;d on your condition,
I should not know you, Brutus. Dear my lord,
Make me acquainted with your cause of grief.

[I am not well in health, and that is all.]

Brutus is wise, and, were he not in health,
He would embrace the means to come by it.

[Why, so I do. Good Portia, go to bed.]

Is Brutus sick? and is it physical
To walk unbraced and suck up the humours
Of the dank morning? What, is Brutus sick,
And will he steal out of his wholesome bed,
To dare the vile contagion of the night
And tempt the rheumy and unpurged air
To add unto his sickness? No, my Brutus;
You have some sick offence within your mind,
Which, by the right and virtue of my place,
I ought to know of: and, upon my knees,
I charm you, by my once-commended beauty,
By all your vows of love and that great vow
Which did incorporate and make us one,
That you unfold to me, yourself, your half,
Why you are heavy, and what men to-night
Have had to resort to you: for here have been
Some six or seven, who did hide their faces
Even from darkness.</string>

Ne&apos;er look&apos;d but on my back; when they shall see
The face of Caesar, they are vanished.]

Caesar, I never stood on ceremonies,
Yet now they fright me. There is one within,
Besides the things that we have heard and seen,
Recounts most horrid sights seen by the watch.
A lioness hath whelped in the streets;
And graves have yawn&apos;d, and yielded up their dead;
Fierce fiery warriors fought upon the clouds,
In ranks and squadrons and right form of war,
Which drizzled blood upon the Capitol;
The noise of battle hurtled in the air,
Horses did neigh, and dying men did groan,
And ghosts did shriek and squeal about the streets.
O Caesar! these things are beyond all use,
And I do fear them.

[What can be avoided
Whose end is purposed by the mighty gods?
Yet Caesar shall go forth; for these predictions
Are to the world in general as to Caesar.]

When beggars die, there are no comets seen;
The heavens themselves blaze forth the death of princes.</string>

Calpurnia here, my wife, stays me at home:

Which, like a fountain with an hundred spouts,
Did run pure blood: and many lusty Romans
Came smiling, and did bathe their hands in it:
And these does she apply for warnings, and portents,
And evils imminent; and on her knee
Hath begg&apos;d that I will stay at home to-day.

		<string>I must prevent thee, Cimber.
These couchings and these lowly courtesies
Might fire the blood of ordinary men,
And turn pre-ordinance and first decree
Into the law of children. Be not fond,
To think that Caesar bears such rebel blood
That will be thaw&apos;d from the true quality
With that which melteth fools; I mean, sweet words,
Low-crooked court&apos;sies and base spaniel-fawning.
Thy brother by decree is banished:
If thou dost bend and pray and fawn for him,
I spurn thee like a cur out of my way.
Know, Caesar doth not wrong, nor without cause
Will he be satisfied.

[Is there no voice more worthy than my own
To sound more sweetly in great Caesar&apos;s ear
For the repealing of my banish&apos;d brother?]

[I kiss thy hand, but not in flattery, Caesar;
Desiring thee that Publius Cimber may
Have an immediate freedom of repeal.]

What, Brutus!

[Pardon, Caesar; Caesar, pardon:
As low as to thy foot doth Cassius fall,
To beg enfranchisement for Publius Cimber.]

I could be well moved, if I were as you:
If I could pray to move, prayers would move me:
But I am constant as the northern star,
Of whose true-fix&apos;d and resting quality
There is no fellow in the firmament.
The skies are painted with unnumber&apos;d sparks,
They are all fire and every one doth shine,
But there&apos;s but one in all doth hold his place:
So in the world; &apos;tis furnish&apos;d well with men,
And men are flesh and blood, and apprehensive;
Yet in the number I do know but one
That unassailable holds on his rank,
Unshaked of motion: and that I am he,
Let me a little show it, even in this;
That I was constant Cimber should be banish&apos;d,
And constant do remain to keep him so.</string>

Thorough the hazards of this untrod state

You see we do, yet see you but our hands
And this the bleeding business they have done:
Our hearts you see not; they are pitiful;
And pity to the general wrong of Rome--
As fire drives out fire, so pity pity--
Hath done this deed on Caesar. For your part,
To you our swords have leaden points, Mark Antony:
Our arms, in strength of malice, and our hearts
Of brothers&apos; temper, do receive you in
With all kind love, good thoughts, and reverence.

Only be patient till we have appeased
The multitude, beside themselves with fear,
And then we will deliver you the cause,
Why I, that did love Caesar when I struck him,
Have thus proceeded.</string>

Gentlemen all,--alas, what shall I say?
My credit now stands on such slippery ground,

Either a coward or a flatterer.
That I did love thee, Caesar, O, &apos;tis true:
If then thy spirit look upon us now,
Shall it not grieve thee dearer than thy death,
To see thy thy Anthony making his peace,
Shaking the bloody fingers of thy foes,
Most noble! in the presence of thy corse?
Had I as many eyes as thou hast wounds,
Weeping as fast as they stream forth thy blood,
It would become me better than to close
In terms of friendship with thine enemies.
Pardon me, Julius! Here wast thou bay&apos;d, brave hart;
Here didst thou fall; and here thy hunters stand,
Sign&apos;d in thy spoil, and crimson&apos;d in thy lethe.
O world, thou wast the forest to this hart;

That I am meek and gentle with these butchers!
Thou art the ruins of the noblest man
That ever lived in the tide of times.
Woe to the hand that shed this costly blood!
Over thy wounds now do I prophesy,--
Which, like dumb mouths, do ope their ruby lips,
To beg the voice and utterance of my tongue--
A curse shall light upon the limbs of men;
Domestic fury and fierce civil strife
Shall cumber all the parts of Italy;
Blood and destruction shall be so in use
And dreadful objects so familiar
That mothers shall but smile when they behold
Their infants quarter&apos;d with the hands of war;
All pity choked with custom of fell deeds:
And Caesar&apos;s spirit, ranging for revenge,
With Ate by his side come hot from hell,
Shall in these confines with a monarch&apos;s voice
Cry &apos;Havoc,&apos; and let slip the dogs of war;
That this foul deed shall smell above the earth
With carrion men, groaning for burial.</string>

Romans, countrymen, and lovers! hear me for my
cause, and be silent, that you may hear: believe me
for mine honour, and have respect to mine honour, that
you may believe: censure me in your wisdom, and
awake your senses, that you may the better judge.
If there be any in this assembly, any dear friend of
Caesar&apos;s, to him I say, that Brutus&apos; love to Caesar
was no less than his. If then that friend demand
why Brutus rose against Caesar, this is my answer:
--Not that I loved Caesar less, but that I loved
Rome more. Had you rather Caesar were living and
die all slaves, than that Caesar were dead, to live
all free men? As Caesar loved me, I weep for him;
as he was fortunate, I rejoice at it; as he was
valiant, I honour him: but, as he was ambitious, I
slew him. There is tears for his love; joy for his
fortune; honour for his valour; and death for his
ambition. Who is here so base that would be a
bondman? If any, speak; for him have I offended.
Who is here so rude that would not be a Roman? If
any, speak; for him have I offended. Who is here so
vile that will not love his country? If any, speak;
for him have I offended. I pause for a reply.</string>

		<string>Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears;
I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him.
The evil that men do lives after them;
The good is oft interred with their bones;
So let it be with Caesar. The noble Brutus
Hath told you Caesar was ambitious:
If it were so, it was a grievous fault,
And grievously hath Caesar answer&apos;d it.
Here, under leave of Brutus and the rest--
For Brutus is an honourable man;
So are they all, all honourable men--
Come I to speak in Caesar&apos;s funeral.
He was my friend, faithful and just to me:
But Brutus says he was ambitious;
And Brutus is an honourable man.
He hath brought many captives home to Rome
Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill:
Did this in Caesar seem ambitious?
When that the poor have cried, Caesar hath wept:
Ambition should be made of sterner stuff:
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;
And Brutus is an honourable man.
You all did see that on the Lupercal
I thrice presented him a kingly crown,
Which he did thrice refuse: was this ambition?
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;
And, sure, he is an honourable man.
I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke,
But here I am to speak what I do know.
You all did love him once, not without cause:
What cause withholds you then, to mourn for him?
O judgment! thou art fled to brutish beasts,
And men have lost their reason. Bear with me;
My heart is in the coffin there with Caesar,
And I must pause till it come back to me.</string>

Have stood against the world; now lies he there.
And none so poor to do him reverence.
O masters, if I were disposed to stir
Your hearts and minds to mutiny and rage,
I should do Brutus wrong, and Cassius wrong,
Who, you all know, are honourable men:
I will not do them wrong; I rather choose
To wrong the dead, to wrong myself and you,
Than I will wrong such honourable men.
But here&apos;s a parchment with the seal of Caesar;
I found it in his closet, &apos;tis his will:
Let but the commons hear this testament--
Which, pardon me, I do not mean to read--
And they would go and kiss dead Caesar&apos;s wounds
And dip their napkins in his sacred blood,
Yea, beg a hair of him for memory,
And, dying, mention it within their wills,
Bequeathing it as a rich legacy
Unto their issue.

[We&apos;ll hear the will: read it, Mark Antony.]

[The will, the will! we will hear Caesar&apos;s will.]

Have patience, gentle friends, I must not read it;
It is not meet you know how Caesar loved you.
You are not wood, you are not stones, but men;
And, being men, bearing the will of Caesar,
It will inflame you, it will make you mad:
&apos;Tis good you know not that you are his heirs;
For, if you should, O, what would come of it!</string>

You all do know this mantle: I remember
The first time ever Caesar put it on;
&apos;Twas on a summer&apos;s evening, in his tent,
That day he overcame the Nervii:
Look, in this place ran Cassius&apos; dagger through:
See what a rent the envious Casca made:
Through this the well-beloved Brutus stabb&apos;d;
And as he pluck&apos;d his cursed steel away,
Mark how the blood of Caesar follow&apos;d it,
As rushing out of doors, to be resolved
If Brutus so unkindly knock&apos;d, or no;
For Brutus, as you know, was Caesar&apos;s angel:
Judge, O you gods, how dearly Caesar loved him!
This was the most unkindest cut of all;
For when the noble Caesar saw him stab,
Ingratitude, more strong than traitors&apos; arms,
Quite vanquish&apos;d him: then burst his mighty heart;
And, in his mantle muffling up his face,
Even at the base of Pompey&apos;s statua,
Which all the while ran blood, great Caesar fell.
O, what a fall was there, my countrymen!
Then I, and you, and all of us fell down,
Whilst bloody treason flourish&apos;d over us.
O, now you weep; and, I perceive, you feel
The dint of pity: these are gracious drops.
Kind souls, what, weep you when you but behold
Our Caesar&apos;s vesture wounded? Look you here,
Here is himself, marr&apos;d, as you see, with traitors.

[O piteous spectacle!]
[O noble Caesar!]
[O woful day!]
[O traitors, villains!]
[O most bloody sight!]
[We will be revenged.]
[Revenge! About! Seek! Burn! Fire! Kill! Slay!
Let not a traitor live!]

Stay, countrymen.

[Peace there! hear the noble Antony.]
[We&apos;ll hear him, we&apos;ll follow him, we&apos;ll die with him.]

Good friends, sweet friends, let me not stir you up
To such a sudden flood of mutiny.
They that have done this deed are honourable:
What private griefs they have, alas, I know not,
That made them do it: they are wise and honourable,
And will, no doubt, with reasons answer you.
I come not, friends, to steal away your hearts:
I am no orator, as Brutus is;
But, as you know me all, a plain blunt man,
That love my friend; and that they know full well
That gave me public leave to speak of him:
For I have neither wit, nor words, nor worth,
Action, nor utterance, nor the power of speech,
To stir men&apos;s blood: I only speak right on;
I tell you that which you yourselves do know;
Show you sweet Caesar&apos;s wounds, poor poor dumb mouths,
And bid them speak for me: but were I Brutus,
And Brutus Antony, there were an Antony
Would ruffle up your spirits and put a tongue
In every wound of Caesar that should move
The stones of Rome to rise and mutiny.</string>

To groan and sweat under the business,
Either led or driven, as we point the way;
And having brought our treasure where we will,

Like to the empty ass, to shake his ears,

Which I respect not. I did send to you
For certain sums of gold, which you denied me:
For I can raise no money by vile means:
By heaven, I had rather coin my heart,
And drop my blood for drachmas, than to wring
From the hard hands of peasants their vile trash
By any indirection: I did send
To you for gold to pay my legions,
Which you denied me: was that done like Cassius?
Should I have answer&apos;d Caius Cassius so?
When Marcus Brutus grows so covetous,
To lock such rascal counters from his friends,
Be ready, gods, with all your thunderbolts;
Dash him to pieces!

Our legions are brim-full, our cause is ripe:
The enemy increaseth every day;
We, at the height, are ready to decline.
There is a tide in the affairs of men,
Which, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune;
Omitted, all the voyage of their life
Is bound in shallows and in miseries.
On such a full sea are we now afloat;
And we must take the current when it serves,

Upon one battle all our liberties.
You know that I held Epicurus strong
And his opinion: now I change my mind,
And partly credit things that do presage.
Coming from Sardis, on our former ensign
Two mighty eagles fell, and there they perch&apos;d,
Gorging and feeding from our soldiers&apos; hands;
Who to Philippi here consorted us:
This morning are they fled away and gone;
And in their steads do ravens, crows and kites,
Fly o&apos;er our heads and downward look on us,
As we were sickly prey: their shadows seem
A canopy most fatal, under which
Our army lies, ready to give up the ghost.</string>

The last of all the Romans, fare thee well!
It is impossible that ever Rome
Should breed thy fellow. Friends, I owe more tears
To this dead man than you shall see me pay.
I shall find time, Cassius, I shall find time.
Come, therefore, and to Thasos send his body:
His funerals shall not be in our camp,
Lest it discomfort us. Lucilius, come;
And come, young Cato; let us to the field.
Labeo and Flavius, set our battles on:
&apos;Tis three o&apos;clock; and, Romans, yet ere night
We shall try fortune in a second fight.</string>

Strato, thou hast been all this while asleep;
Farewell to thee too, Strato. Countrymen,
My heart doth joy that yet in all my life
I found no man but he was true to me.
I shall have glory by this losing day
More than Octavius and Mark Antony
By this vile conquest shall attain unto.
So fare you well at once; for Brutus&apos; tongue
Hath almost ended his life&apos;s history:
Night hangs upon mine eyes; my bones would rest,

Give me the map there. Know that we have divided
In three our kingdom: and &apos;tis our fast intent
To shake all cares and business from our age;
Conferring them on younger strengths, while we
Unburthen&apos;d crawl toward death. Our son of Cornwall,
And you, our no less loving son of Albany,
We have this hour a constant will to publish
Our daughters&apos; several dowers, that future strife
May be prevented now. The princes, France and Burgundy,
Great rivals in our youngest daughter&apos;s love,
Long in our court have made their amorous sojourn,
And here are to be answer&apos;d. Tell me, my daughters,--
Since now we will divest us both of rule,
Interest of territory, cares of state,--
Which of you shall we say doth love us most?
That we our largest bounty may extend
Where nature doth with merit challenge. Goneril,
Our eldest-born, speak first.</string>

		<string>&apos;Tis more than need.
Have at you, then, affection&apos;s men at arms.
Consider what you first did swear unto,
To fast, to study, and to see no woman;
Flat treason &apos;gainst the kingly state of youth.
Say, can you fast? your stomachs are too young;
And abstinence engenders maladies.
And where that you have vow&apos;d to study, lords,
In that each of you have forsworn his book,
Can you still dream and pore and thereon look?
For when would you, my lord, or you, or you,
Have found the ground of study&apos;s excellence
Without the beauty of a woman&apos;s face?
From women&apos;s eyes this doctrine I derive; They are the ground, the books, the academes From whence doth spring the true Promethean fire

Why, universal plodding poisons up
The nimble spirits in the arteries,
As motion and long-during action tires
The sinewy vigour of the traveller.
Now, for not looking on a woman&apos;s face,
You have in that forsworn the use of eyes
And study too, the causer of your vow;
For where is any author in the world
Teaches such beauty as a woman&apos;s eye?
Learning is but an adjunct to ourself
And where we are our learning likewise is:
Then when ourselves we see in ladies&apos; eyes,
Do we not likewise see our learning there?
O, we have made a vow to study, lords,
And in that vow we have forsworn our books.
For when would you, my liege, or you, or you,
In leaden contemplation have found out
Such fiery numbers as the prompting eyes
Of beauty&apos;s tutors have enrich&apos;d you with?
Other slow arts entirely keep the brain;
And therefore, finding barren practisers,
Scarce show a harvest of their heavy toil:
But love, first learned in a lady&apos;s eyes,
Lives not alone immured in the brain;
But, with the motion of all elements,
Courses as swift as thought in every power,
And gives to every power a double power,
Above their functions and their offices.
It adds a precious seeing to the eye;
A lover&apos;s eyes will gaze an eagle blind;
A lover&apos;s ear will hear the lowest sound,
When the suspicious head of theft is stopp&apos;d:
Love&apos;s feeling is more soft and sensible
Than are the tender horns of cockl&apos;d snails;
Love&apos;s tongue proves dainty Bacchus gross in taste:
For valour, is not Love a Hercules,
Still climbing trees in the Hesperides?
Subtle as Sphinx; as sweet and musical
As bright Apollo&apos;s lute, strung with his hair:
And when Love speaks, the voice of all the gods
Makes heaven drowsy with the harmony.
Never durst poet touch a pen to write
Until his ink were temper&apos;d with Love&apos;s sighs;
O, then his lines would ravish savage ears
And plant in tyrants mild humility.
From women&apos;s eyes this doctrine I derive:
They sparkle still the right Promethean fire;
They are the books, the arts, the academes,
That show, contain and nourish all the world:
Else none at all in ought proves excellent.
Then fools you were these women to forswear,
Or keeping what is sworn, you will prove fools.
For wisdom&apos;s sake, a word that all men love,
Or for love&apos;s sake, a word that loves all men,
Or for men&apos;s sake, the authors of these women,
Or women&apos;s sake, by whom we men are men,
Let us once lose our oaths to find ourselves,
Or else we lose ourselves to keep our oaths.
It is religion to be thus forsworn,
For charity itself fulfills the law,
And who can sever love from charity?</string>

Not to be over-ruled. Idle old man,

Old fools are babes again; and must be used
With cheques as flatteries,--when they are seen abused.

		<string>Life and death! I am ashamed
That thou hast power to shake my manhood thus;
That these hot tears, which break from me perforce,
Should make thee worth them. Blasts and fogs upon thee!
The untented woundings of a father&apos;s curse
Pierce every sense about thee! Old fond eyes,
Beweep this cause again, I&apos;ll pluck ye out,
And cast you, with the waters that you lose,
To temper clay. Yea, it is come to this?
Let is be so: yet have I left a daughter,
Who, I am sure, is kind and comfortable:
When she shall hear this of thee, with her nails
She&apos;ll flay thy wolvish visage. Thou shalt find
That I&apos;ll resume the shape which thou dost think
I have cast off for ever: thou shalt,
I warrant thee.</string>

[Pursue him, ho! Go after.]
[exeunt some Servants]
[By no means what?]

Persuade me to the murder of your lordship;
But that I told him, the revenging gods
&apos;Gainst parricides did all their thunders bend;
Spoke, with how manifold and strong a bond
The child was bound to the father; sir, in fine,
Seeing how loathly opposite I stood
To his unnatural purpose, in fell motion,
With his prepared sword, he charges home
My unprovided body, lanced mine arm:
But when he saw my best alarum&apos;d spirits,
Bold in the quarrel&apos;s right, roused to the encounter,
Or whether gasted by the noise I made,
Full suddenly he fled.

[Let him fly far:
Not in this land shall he remain uncaught;
And found--dispatch. The noble duke my master,
My worthy arch and patron, comes to-night:
By his authority I will proclaim it,
That he which finds him shall deserve our thanks,
Bringing the murderous coward to the stake;
He that conceals him, death.]

When I dissuaded him from his intent,
And found him pight to do it, with curst speech
I threaten&apos;d to discover him: he replied,
&apos;Thou unpossessing bastard! dost thou think,
If I would stand against thee, would the reposal
Of any trust, virtue, or worth in thee
Make thy words faith&apos;d? No: what I should deny,--
As this I would: ay, though thou didst produce
My very character,--I&apos;ld turn it all
To thy suggestion, plot, and damned practise:
And thou must make a dullard of the world,
If they not thought the profits of my death
Were very pregnant and potential spurs
To make thee seek it.&apos;</string>

That such a slave as this should wear a sword,
Who wears no honesty. Such smiling rogues as these,
Like rats, oft bite the holy cords a-twain
Which are too intrinse t&apos; unloose; smooth every passion
That in the natures of their lords rebel;
Bring oil to fire, snow to their colder moods;
Renege, affirm, and turn their halcyon beaks
With every gale and vary of their masters,
Knowing nought, like dogs, but following.
A plague upon your epileptic visage!
Smile you my speeches, as I were a fool?

remember thy courtesy; I beseech thee, apparel thy

fable: some certain special honours it pleaseth his
greatness to impart to Armado, a soldier, a man of
travel, that hath seen the world; but let that pass.
The very all of all is,--but, sweet heart, I do
implore secrecy,--that the king would have me
present the princess, sweet chuck, with some
delightful ostentation, or show, or pageant, or
antique, or firework. Now, understanding that the

Brought near to beast: my face I&apos;ll grime with filth;
Blanket my loins: elf all my hair in knots;
And with presented nakedness out-face
The winds and persecutions of the sky.
The country gives me proof and precedent
Of Bedlam beggars, who, with roaring voices,
Strike in their numb&apos;d and mortified bare arms
Pins, wooden pricks, nails, sprigs of rosemary;
And with this horrible object, from low farms,
Poor pelting villages, sheep-cotes, and mills,
Sometime with lunatic bans, sometime with prayers,
Enforce their charity. Poor Turlygod! poor Tom!

Ere I was risen from the place that show&apos;d

Stew&apos;d in his haste, half breathless, panting forth
From Goneril his mistress salutations;
Deliver&apos;d letters, spite of intermission,
Which presently they read: on whose contents,
They summon&apos;d up their meiny, straight took horse;
Commanded me to follow, and attend
The leisure of their answer; gave me cold looks:
And meeting here the other messenger,
Whose welcome, I perceived, had poison&apos;d mine,--
Being the very fellow that of late
Display&apos;d so saucily against your highness,--
Having more man than wit about me, drew:
He raised the house with loud and coward cries.
Your son and daughter found this trespass worth
The shame which here it suffers.</string>

No, but not yet: may be he is not well:

Or at their chamber-door I&apos;ll beat the drum
Till it cry sleep to death.</string>

Or ere I&apos;ll weep. O fool, I shall go mad!</string>

Bids the winds blow the earth into the sea,
Or swell the curled water &apos;bove the main,
That things might change or cease; tears his white hair,
Which the impetuous blasts, with eyeless rage,
Catch in their fury, and make nothing of;
Strives in his little world of man to out-scorn

Keep their fur dry, unbonneted he runs,

Kent tells a gentleman of the conflict between Albany and Cornwall, the two most powerful men in England, and how French spies are taking advantage of their feud to lay the foundation for a French invasion. Kent urges the gentleman to go to nearby Dover to tell the people about King Lear&apos;s unfair treatment at the hands of Albany, Cornwall, and his own daughters.</string>

		<string>Sir, I do know you;
And dare, upon the warrant of my note,
Commend a dear thing to you. There is division,
Although as yet the face of it be cover&apos;d
With mutual cunning, &apos;twixt Albany and Cornwall;
Who have--as who have not, that their great stars
Throned and set high?--servants, who seem no less,
Which are to France the spies and speculations
Intelligent of our state; what hath been seen,
Either in snuffs and packings of the dukes,
Or the hard rein which both of them have borne
Against the old kind king; or something deeper,
Whereof perchance these are but furnishings;
But, true it is, from France there comes a power
Into this scatter&apos;d kingdom; who already,
Wise in our negligence, have secret feet
In some of our best ports, and are at point
To show their open banner. Now to you:
If on my credit you dare build so far
To make your speed to Dover, you shall find
Some that will thank you, making just report
Of how unnatural and bemadding sorrow
The king hath cause to plain.
I am a gentleman of blood and breeding;
And, from some knowledge and assurance, offer
This office to you.

Here stand I. lady, dart thy skill at me;
Bruise me with scorn, confound me with a flout;
Thrust thy sharp wit quite through my ignorance;
Cut me to pieces with thy keen conceit;
And I will wish thee never more to dance,
Nor never more in Russian habit wait.
O, never will I trust to speeches penn&apos;d,
Nor to the motion of a schoolboy&apos;s tongue, 
Nor never come in vizard to my friend,
Nor woo in rhyme, like a blind harper&apos;s song!
Taffeta phrases, silken terms precise,
Three-piled hyperboles, spruce affectation,
Figures pedantical; these summer-flies 
Have blown me full of maggot ostentation:
I do forswear them; and I here protest,
By this white glove;--how white the hand, God knows!--
Henceforth my wooing mind shall be express&apos;d
In russet yeas and honest kersey noes: 
And, to begin, wench,--so God help me, la!--

When priests are more in word than matter;
When brewers mar their malt with water;
When nobles are their tailors&apos; tutors;
No heretics burn&apos;d, but wenches&apos; suitors;
When every case in law is right;
No squire in debt, nor no poor knight;
When slanders do not live in tongues;
Nor cutpurses come not to throngs;
When usurers tell their gold i&apos; the field;
And bawds and whores do churches build;
Then shall the realm of Albion
Come to great confusion:
Then comes the time, who lives to see&apos;t,
That going shall be used with feet.
This prophecy Merlin shall make; for I live before his time.</string>

Go to; say you nothing. There&apos;s a division betwixt the dukes; and a worse matter than that: I have received a letter this night; &apos;tis dangerous to be spoken; I have locked the letter in my closet: these injuries the king now bears will be revenged home; there&apos;s part of a power already footed: we must incline to the king. I will seek him, and privily relieve him: go you and maintain talk with the duke, that my charity be not of him perceived: if he ask for me. I am ill, and gone to bed. Though I die for it, as no less is threatened me, the king my old master must be relieved. There is some strange thing toward, Edmund; pray you, be careful.</string>

But if thy flight lay toward the raging sea,

The body&apos;s delicate: the tempest in my mind
Doth from my senses take all feeling else
Save what beats there. Filial ingratitude!

For lifting food to&apos;t? But I will punish home:
No, I will weep no more. In such a night
To shut me out! Pour on; I will endure.

		<string>Angelo,
There is a kind of character in thy life,
That to the observer doth thy history
Fully unfold. Thyself and thy belongings
Are not thine own so proper as to waste
Thyself upon thy virtues, they on thee.
Heaven doth with us as we with torches do,
Not light them for themselves; for if our virtues
Did not go forth of us, &apos;twere all alike
As if we had them not. Spirits are not finely touch&apos;d
But to fine issues, nor Nature never lends
The smallest scruple of her excellence
But, like a thrifty goddess, she determines
Herself the glory of a creditor,
Both thanks and use. But I do bend my speech
To one that can my part in him advertise;
Hold therefore, Angelo:--
In our remove be thou at full ourself;
Mortality and mercy in Vienna
Live in thy tongue and heart: old Escalus,
Though first in question, is thy secondary.
Take thy commission.</string>

		<string>When we our betters see bearing our woes,
We scarcely think our miseries our foes.
Who alone suffers suffers most i&apos; the mind,
Leaving free things and happy shows behind:
But then the mind much sufferance doth o&apos;er skip,
When grief hath mates, and bearing fellowship.
How light and portable my pain seems now,
When that which makes me bend makes the king bow,
He childed as I father&apos;d! Tom, away!
Mark the high noises; and thyself bewray,
When false opinion, whose wrong thought defiles thee,
In thy just proof, repeals and reconciles thee.
What will hap more to-night, safe &apos;scape the king!
Lurk, lurk.</string>

It is the cowish terror of his spirit,
That dares not undertake: he&apos;ll not feel wrongs
Which tie him to an answer. Our wishes on the way
May prove effects. Back, Edmund, to my brother;
Hasten his musters and conduct his powers:
I must change arms at home, and give the distaff
Into my husband&apos;s hands. This trusty servant
Shall pass between us: ere long you are like to hear,
If you dare venture in your own behalf,

Would stretch thy spirits up into the air:

You are not worth the dust which the rude wind
Blows in your face. I fear your disposition:
That nature, which contemns its origin,
Cannot be border&apos;d certain in itself;
She that herself will sliver and disbranch
From her material sap, perforce must wither
And come to deadly use.

[No more; the text is foolish.]

Wisdom and goodness to the vile seem vile:
Filths savour but themselves. What have you done?
Tigers, not daughters, what have you perform&apos;d?
A father, and a gracious aged man,
Whose reverence even the head-lugg&apos;d bear would lick,
Most barbarous, most degenerate! have you madded.
Could my good brother suffer you to do it?
A man, a prince, by him so benefited!
If that the heavens do not their visible spirits
Send quickly down to tame these vile offences,
It will come,
Humanity must perforce prey on itself,
Like monsters of the deep.</string>

I speak in understanding; you are; I know&apos;t:
Therefore I do advise you, take this note:
My lord is dead; Edmund and I have talk&apos;d;
And more convenient is he for my hand

If you do find him, pray you, give him this;
And when your mistress hears thus much from you,
I pray, desire her call her wisdom to her.
So, fare you well.

Preferment falls on him that cuts him off.</string>

Diminish&apos;d to her cock; her cock, a buoy
Almost too small for sight: the murmuring surge,

Got &apos;tween the lawful sheets.

Lear tells the blind Gloucester that he can see without eyes if he listens; but then admits that telling who is who is difficult in a society that is based on hypocrisy and injustice. He reflects on the injustice of ill treatment of the poor when the rich are unpunished for similar crimes, and that only crooked politicians pretend to see when they can&apos;t. He then asks either Gloucester or his servant Caius to pull off his boots.</string>

[Ay, sir.]

And the creature run from the cur? There thou mightst behold the great image of authority: a dog&apos;s obeyed in office.
Thou rascal beadle, hold thy bloody hand!
Why dost thou lash that whore? Strip thine own back;
Thou hotly lust&apos;st to use her in that kind
For which thou whipp&apos;st her. The usurer hangs the cozener.
Through tatter&apos;d clothes small vices do appear;
Robes and furr&apos;d gowns hide all. Plate sin with gold,
And the strong lance of justice hurtless breaks:
Arm it in rags, a pigmy&apos;s straw does pierce it.
None does offend, none, I say, none; I&apos;ll able &apos;em:
Take that of me, my friend, who have the power
To seal the accuser&apos;s lips. Get thee glass eyes;

Edmund tells Albany that he had Lear and Cordelia aside in a private cell, as their populairty among the people could have the effect of inciting mutiny among the troops. He expresses that even a just war makes soldiers tense and tempermental, and urges that they continue talking elsewhere.</string>

		<string>Sir, I thought it fit
To send the old and miserable king
To some retention and appointed guard;
Whose age has charms in it, whose title more,
To pluck the common bosom on his side,
An turn our impress&apos;d lances in our eyes
Which do command them. With him I sent the queen;
My reason all the same; and they are ready
To-morrow, or at further space, to appear
Where you shall hold your session. At this time
We sweat and bleed: the friend hath lost his friend;
And the best quarrels, in the heat, are cursed
By those that feel their sharpness:
The question of Cordelia and her father
Requires a fitter place.</string>

Despite thy victor sword and fire-new fortune,

Edgar recounts to Albany what happened after he was accused of conspiracy; how he disguised himself as mad Tom, reunite with his blind father Gloucester, reveals his true identity only recently, received Gloucester approval to duel his brother Edmund, and finally saw his father die from conflicting passions. He goes on to summarize the even more lamentable tragedy of Kent, who was happy to see Edgar on discovering his identity, but was so overcome with grief while recounting Lear&apos;s miseries, that he fell into a daze.</string>

		<string>[Where have you hid yourself?
How have you known the miseries of your father?]

By nursing them, my lord. List a brief tale;
And when &apos;tis told, O, that my heart would burst!
The bloody proclamation to escape,
That follow&apos;d me so near,--O, our lives&apos; sweetness!
That we the pain of death would hourly die
Rather than die at once!--taught me to shift
Into a madman&apos;s rags; to assume a semblance
That very dogs disdain&apos;d: and in this habit
Met I my father with his bleeding rings,
Their precious stones new lost: became his guide,
Led him, begg&apos;d for him, saved him from despair;
Never,--O fault!--reveal&apos;d myself unto him,
Until some half-hour past, when I was arm&apos;d:
Not sure, though hoping, of this good success,
I ask&apos;d his blessing, and from first to last
Told him my pilgrimage: but his flaw&apos;d heart,
Alack, too weak the conflict to support!
&apos;Twixt two extremes of passion, joy and grief,
Burst smilingly.

[This speech of yours hath moved me,
And shall perchance do good: but speak you on;
You look as you had something more to say.]

[If there be more, more woeful, hold it in;
For I am almost ready to dissolve,
Hearing of this.]

This would have seem&apos;d a period
To such as love not sorrow; but another,
To amplify too much, would make much more,
And top extremity.
Whilst I was big in clamour came there in a man,
Who, having seen me in my worst estate,
Shunn&apos;d my abhorr&apos;d society; but then, finding
Who &apos;twas that so endured, with his strong arms
He fastened on my neck, and bellow&apos;d out
As he&apos;ld burst heaven; threw him on my father;
Told the most piteous tale of Lear and him
That ever ear received: which in recounting
His grief grew puissant and the strings of life
Began to crack: twice then the trumpets sounded,
And there I left him tranced.

[But who was this?]

Kent, sir, the banish&apos;d Kent; who in disguise
Follow&apos;d his enemy king, and did him service
Improper for a slave.</string>

Which ne&apos;er shook hands, nor bade farewell to him,
Till he unseam&apos;d him from the nave to the chaps,
And fix&apos;d his head upon our battlements.</string>

My plenteous joys,
Wanton in fulness, seek to hide themselves
In drops of sorrow. Sons, kinsmen, thanes,
And you whose places are the nearest, know
We will establish our estate upon
Our eldest, Malcolm, whom we name hereafter
The Prince of Cumberland; which honour must
Not unaccompanied invest him only,
But signs of nobleness, like stars, shall shine
On all deservers. From hence to Inverness,

		<string>&apos;They met me in the day of success: and I have
learned by the perfectest report, they have more in
them than mortal knowledge. When I burned in desire
to question them further, they made themselves air,
into which they vanished. Whiles I stood rapt in
the wonder of it, came missives from the king, who
all-hailed me &apos;Thane of Cawdor;&apos; by which title,
before, these weird sisters saluted me, and referred
me to the coming on of time, with &apos;Hail, king that
shalt be!&apos; This have I thought good to deliver
thee, my dearest partner of greatness, that thou
mightst not lose the dues of rejoicing, by being
ignorant of what greatness is promised thee. Lay it
to thy heart, and farewell.&apos;
Glamis thou art, and Cawdor; and shalt be
What thou art promised: yet do I fear thy nature;
It is too full o&apos; the milk of human kindness
To catch the nearest way: thou wouldst be great;
Art not without ambition, but without
The illness should attend it: what thou wouldst highly,
That wouldst thou holily; wouldst not play false,
And yet wouldst wrongly win: thou&apos;ldst have, great Glamis,
That which cries &apos;Thus thou must do, if thou have it;
And that which rather thou dost fear to do
Than wishest should be undone.&apos; Hie thee hither,
That I may pour my spirits in thine ear;
And chastise with the valour of my tongue
All that impedes thee from the golden round,
Which fate and metaphysical aid doth seem
To have thee crown&apos;d withal.</string>

Because we see it; but what we do not see
We tread upon, and never think of it.
You may not so extenuate his offence
For I have had such faults; but rather tell me,

Let mine own judgment pattern out my death,
And nothing come in partial. Sir, he must die.</string>

Letting &apos;I dare not&apos; wait upon &apos;I would,&apos;

When you durst do it, then you were a man;

Shall be a fume, and the receipt of reason

Their drenched natures lie as in a death,
What cannot you and I perform upon
The unguarded Duncan? what not put upon
His spongy officers, who shall bear the guilt
Of our great quell?</string>

The handle toward my hand? Come, let me clutch thee.
I have thee not, and yet I see thee still.
Art thou not, fatal vision, sensible
To feeling as to sight? or art thou but
A dagger of the mind, a false creation,
Proceeding from the heat-oppressed brain?
I see thee yet, in form as palpable
As this which now I draw.
Thou marshall&apos;st me the way that I was going;
And such an instrument I was to use.
Mine eyes are made the fools o&apos; the other senses,
Or else worth all the rest; I see thee still,
And on thy blade and dudgeon gouts of blood,
Which was not so before. There&apos;s no such thing:
It is the bloody business which informs
Thus to mine eyes. Now o&apos;er the one halfworld
Nature seems dead, and wicked dreams abuse
The curtain&apos;d sleep; witchcraft celebrates
Pale Hecate&apos;s offerings, and wither&apos;d murder,
Alarum&apos;d by his sentinel, the wolf,
Whose howl&apos;s his watch, thus with his stealthy pace.
With Tarquin&apos;s ravishing strides, towards his design
Moves like a ghost. Thou sure and firm-set earth,
Hear not my steps, which way they walk, for fear
Thy very stones prate of my whereabout,
And take the present horror from the time,
Which now suits with it. Whiles I threat, he lives:
Words to the heat of deeds too cold breath gives.

[a bell rings]

I go, and it is done; the bell invites me.
Hear it not, Duncan; for it is a knell
That summons thee to heaven or to hell.</string>

Lady Macbeth has fulfilled her part in Duncan&apos;s murder by getting his servants drunk to the point of passing out. In drinking with them, she feels more resolved, but also frightful; she overreacts to an owl, is paranoid that they may have failed, and reveals that she would have done the killing if Duncan less resembled her father.</string>

What hath quench&apos;d them hath given me fire.
Hark! Peace!
It was the owl that shriek&apos;d, the fatal bellman,
Which gives the stern&apos;st good-night. He is about it:
The doors are open; and the surfeited grooms
Do mock their charge with snores: I have drugg&apos;d
their possets,
That death and nature do contend about them,
Whether they live or die.

[Who&apos;s there? what, ho!]

Alack, I am afraid they have awaked,
And &apos;tis not done. The attempt and not the deed
Confounds us. Hark! I laid their daggers ready;
He could not miss &apos;em. Had he not resembled
My father as he slept, I had done&apos;t.

[enter MACBETH]

My husband!

[I have done the deed. Didst thou not hear a noise?]

I heard the owl scream and the crickets cry.

Knock, knock, knock! Who&apos;s there? Faith, here&apos;s an English tailor come hither, for stealing out of a French hose: come in, tailor; here you may roast your goose.

Knock, knock; never at quiet! What are you? But this place is too cold for hell. I&apos;ll devil-porter it no further: I had thought to have let in some of all professions that go the primrose way to the everlasting bonfire.

Stick deep; and in his royalty of nature
Reigns that which would be fear&apos;d: &apos;tis much he dares;
And, to that dauntless temper of his mind,
He hath a wisdom that doth guide his valour
To act in safety. There is none but he
Whose being I do fear: and, under him,
My Genius is rebuked; as, it is said,
Mark Antony&apos;s was by Caesar. He chid the sisters
When first they put the name of king upon me,
And bade them speak to him: then prophet-like
They hail&apos;d him father to a line of kings:
Upon my head they placed a fruitless crown,
And put a barren sceptre in my gripe,
Thence to be wrench&apos;d with an unlineal hand,
No son of mine succeeding. If &apos;t be so,
For Banquo&apos;s issue have I filed my mind;
For them the gracious Duncan have I murder&apos;d;
Put rancours in the vessel of my peace
Only for them; and mine eternal jewel
Given to the common enemy of man,
To make them kings, the seed of Banquo kings!
Rather than so, come fate into the list.
And champion me to the utterance! Who&apos;s there!</string>

Whose absence is no less material to me
Than is his father&apos;s, must embrace the fate
Of that dark hour. Resolve yourselves apart:

Be innocent of the knowledge, dearest chuck,
Till thou applaud the deed. Come, seeling night,
Scarf up the tender eye of pitiful day;
And with thy bloody and invisible hand
Cancel and tear to pieces that great bond
Which keeps me pale! Light thickens; and the crow
Makes wing to the rooky wood:
Good things of day begin to droop and drowse;
While night&apos;s black agents to their preys do rouse.
Thou marvell&apos;st at my words: but hold thee still;
Things bad begun make strong themselves by ill.

		<string>My former speeches have but hit your thoughts,
Which can interpret further: only, I say,
Things have been strangely borne. The
gracious Duncan
Was pitied of Macbeth: marry, he was dead:
And the right-valiant Banquo walk&apos;d too late;
Whom, you may say, if&apos;t please you, Fleance kill&apos;d,
For Fleance fled: men must not walk too late.
Who cannot want the thought how monstrous
It was for Malcolm and for Donalbain
To kill their gracious father? damned fact!
How it did grieve Macbeth! did he not straight
In pious rage the two delinquents tear,
That were the slaves of drink and thralls of sleep?
Was not that nobly done? Ay, and wisely too;
For &apos;twould have anger&apos;d any heart alive
To hear the men deny&apos;t. So that, I say,
He has borne all things well: and I do think
That had he Duncan&apos;s sons under his key--
As, an&apos;t please heaven, he shall not--they
should find
What &apos;twere to kill a father; so should Fleance.
But, peace! for from broad words and &apos;cause he fail&apos;d
His presence at the tyrant&apos;s feast, I hear
Macduff lives in disgrace: sir, can you tell

Fire burn and cauldron bubble.]

Scale of dragon, tooth of wolf,
Witches&apos; mummy, maw and gulf
Of the ravin&apos;d salt-sea shark,
Root of hemlock digg&apos;d i&apos; the dark,
Liver of blaspheming Jew,
Gall of goat, and slips of yew
Silver&apos;d in the moon&apos;s eclipse,
Nose of Turk and Tartar&apos;s lips,
Finger of birth-strangled babe
Ditch-deliver&apos;d by a drab,
Make the gruel thick and slab:
Add thereto a tiger&apos;s chaudron,
For the ingredients of our cauldron.

[A deed without a name.]

I conjure you, by that which you profess,
Howe&apos;er you come to know it, answer me:
Though you untie the winds and let them fight
Against the churches; though the yesty waves
Confound and swallow navigation up;
Though bladed corn be lodged and trees blown down;
Though castles topple on their warders&apos; heads;
Though palaces and pyramids do slope
Their heads to their foundations; though the treasure
Of nature&apos;s germens tumble all together,
Even till destruction sicken; answer me

Thy crown does sear mine eye-balls. And thy hair,

A third is like the former. Filthy hags!
Why do you show me this? A fourth! Start, eyes!
What, will the line stretch out to the crack of doom?
Another yet! A seventh! I&apos;ll see no more:
And yet the eighth appears, who bears a glass
Which shows me many more; and some I see
That two-fold balls and treble scepters carry:
Horrible sight! Now, I see, &apos;tis true;
For the blood-bolter&apos;d Banquo smiles upon me,
And points at them for his.</string>

Unless the deed go with it; from this moment

The castle of Macduff I will surprise;
Seize upon Fife; give to the edge o&apos; the sword
His wife, his babes, and all unfortunate souls
That trace him in his line. No boasting like a fool;

[You must have patience, madam.]

He had none:
His flight was madness: when our actions do not,
Our fears do make us traitors.

[You know not
Whether it was his wisdom or his fear.]

Wisdom! to leave his wife, to leave his babes,
His mansion and his titles in a place
From whence himself does fly? He loves us not;
He wants the natural touch: for the poor wren,
The most diminutive of birds, will fight,
Her young ones in her nest, against the owl.
All is the fear and nothing is the love;
As little is the wisdom, where the flight
So runs against all reason.</string>

The tempter or the tempted, who sins most?
Ha!
Not she: nor doth she tempt: but it is I
That, lying by the violet in the sun, 
Do as the carrion does, not as the flower,
Corrupt with virtuous season. Can it be
That modesty may more betray our sense
Than woman&apos;s lightness? Having waste ground enough,
Shall we desire to raze the sanctuary 
And pitch our evils there? O, fie, fie, fie!
What dost thou, or what art thou, Angelo?
Dost thou desire her foully for those things
That make her good? O, let her brother live!
Thieves for their robbery have authority 
When judges steal themselves. What, do I love her,
That I desire to hear her speak again,
And feast upon her eyes? What is&apos;t I dream on?
O cunning enemy, that, to catch a saint,
With saints dost bait thy hook! Most dangerous 
Is that temptation that doth goad us on
To sin in loving virtue: never could the strumpet,
With all her double vigour, art and nature,
Once stir my temper; but this virtuous maid
Subdues me quite. Even till now, 
When men were fond, I smiled and wonder&apos;d how. </string>

I pray you, school yourself: but for your husband,
He is noble, wise, judicious, and best knows
The fits o&apos; the season. I dare not speak
much further;
But cruel are the times, when we are traitors
And do not know ourselves, when we hold rumour
From what we fear, yet know not what we fear,
But float upon a wild and violent sea
Each way and move. I take my leave of you:
Shall not be long but I&apos;ll be here again:
Things at the worst will cease, or else climb upward
To what they were before. My pretty cousin,
Blessing upon you!

[Father&apos;d he is, and yet he&apos;s fatherless.]

It would be my disgrace and your discomfort:

I speak not as in absolute fear of you.
I think our country sinks beneath the yoke;
It weeps, it bleeds; and each new day a gash
Is added to her wounds: I think withal
There would be hands uplifted in my right;
And here from gracious England have I offer
Of goodly thousands: but, for all this,
When I shall tread upon the tyrant&apos;s head,
Or wear it on my sword, yet my poor country
Shall have more vices than it had before,
More suffer and more sundry ways than ever,
By him that shall succeed.

[What should he be?]

It is myself I mean: in whom I know
All the particulars of vice so grafted
That, when they shall be open&apos;d, black Macbeth
Will seem as pure as snow, and the poor state
Esteem him as a lamb, being compared
With my confineless harms.

[Not in the legions
Of horrid hell can come a devil more damn&apos;d
In evils to top Macbeth.]

I grant him bloody,
Luxurious, avaricious, false, deceitful,
Sudden, malicious, smacking of every sin
That has a name: but there&apos;s no bottom, none,
In my voluptuousness: your wives, your daughters,
Your matrons and your maids, could not fill up
The cistern of my lust, and my desire
All continent impediments would o&apos;erbear
That did oppose my will: better Macbeth
Than such an one to reign.</string>

Oftener upon her knees than on her feet,

Into his power, and modest wisdom plucks me
From over-credulous haste: but God above

At no time broke my faith, would not betray

No less in truth than life: my first false speaking
Was this upon myself: what I am truly,
Is thine and my poor country&apos;s to command:
Whither indeed, before thy here-approach,
Old Siward, with ten thousand warlike men,
Already at a point, was setting forth.

Hanging a golden stamp about their necks,
Put on with holy prayers: and &apos;tis spoken,

The healing benediction. With this strange virtue,

Before we reckon with your several loves,
And make us even with you. My thanes and kinsmen,
Henceforth be earls, the first that ever Scotland
In such an honour named. What&apos;s more to do,
Which would be planted newly with the time,
As calling home our exiled friends abroad
That fled the snares of watchful tyranny;
Producing forth the cruel ministers
Of this dead butcher and his fiend-like queen,
Who, as &apos;tis thought, by self and violent hands
Took off her life; this, and what needful else
That calls upon us, by the grace of Grace,
We will perform in measure, time and place:
So, thanks to all at once and to each one,
Whom we invite to see us crown&apos;d at Scone.</string>

Of my conception. The state, whereon I studied
Is like a good thing, being often read,
Grown fear&apos;d and tedious; yea, my gravity,
Wherein—let no man hear me—I take pride,
Could I with boot change for an idle plume,
Which the air beats for vain. O place, O form,
How often dost thou with thy case, thy habit,
Wrench awe from fools and tie the wiser souls
To thy false seeming! Blood, thou art blood:

In personal suit to make me his lieutenant,

Horribly stuff&apos;d with epithets of war;
And, in conclusion,
Nonsuits my mediators; for, &apos;Certes,&apos; says he,

And what was he?
Forsooth, a great arithmetician,
One Michael Cassio, a Florentine,
A fellow almost damn&apos;d in a fair wife;
That never set a squadron in the field,
Nor the division of a battle knows
More than a spinster; unless the bookish theoric,
Wherein the toged consuls can propose
As masterly as he: mere prattle, without practise,
Is all his soldiership. But he, sir, had the election:
And I, of whom his eyes had seen the proof
At Rhodes, at Cyprus and on other grounds
Christian and heathen, must be be-lee&apos;d and calm&apos;d
By debitor and creditor: this counter-caster,
He, in good time, must his lieutenant be,
And I--God bless the mark!--his Moorship&apos;s ancient.</string>

We cannot all be masters, nor all masters
Cannot be truly follow&apos;d. You shall mark
Many a duteous and knee-crooking knave,

Wears out his time, much like his master&apos;s ass,
For nought but provender, and when he&apos;s old, cashier&apos;d:
Whip me such honest knaves. Others there are
Who, trimm&apos;d in forms and visages of duty,
Keep yet their hearts attending on themselves,
And, throwing but shows of service on their lords,
Do well thrive by them and when they have lined
their coats
Do themselves homage: these fellows have some soul;
And such a one do I profess myself. For, sir,
It is as sure as you are Roderigo,
Were I the Moor, I would not be Iago:
In following him, I follow but myself;
Heaven is my judge, not I for love and duty,
But seeming so, for my peculiar end:
For when my outward action doth demonstrate
The native act and figure of my heart
In compliment extern, &apos;tis not long after
But I will wear my heart upon my sleeve
For daws to peck at: I am not what I am.</string>

If&apos;t be your pleasure and most wise consent,
As partly I find it is, that your fair daughter,
At this odd-even and dull watch o&apos; the night,
Transported, with no worse nor better guard
But with a knave of common hire, a gondolier,
To the gross clasps of a lascivious Moor--
If this be known to you and your allowance,
We then have done you bold and saucy wrongs;
But if you know not this, my manners tell me
We have your wrong rebuke. Do not believe
That, from the sense of all civility,
I thus would play and trifle with your reverence:
Your daughter, if you have not given her leave,
I say again, hath made a gross revolt;
Tying her duty, beauty, wit and fortunes
In an extravagant and wheeling stranger
Of here and every where. Straight satisfy yourself:
If she be in her chamber or your house,
Let loose on me the justice of the state
For thus deluding you.</string>

Cannot with safety cast him, for he&apos;s embark&apos;d
With such loud reason to the Cyprus wars,
Which even now stand in act, that, for their souls,
Another of his fathom they have none,
To lead their business: in which regard,
Though I do hate him as I do hell-pains.
Yet, for necessity of present life,
I must show out a flag and sign of love,
Which is indeed but sign. That you shall surely find him,
Lead to the Sagittary the raised search;
And there will I be with him. So, farewell.</string>

And little of this great world can I speak,
More than pertains to feats of broil and battle,
And therefore little shall I grace my cause
In speaking for myself. Yet, by your gracious patience,
I will a round unvarnish&apos;d tale deliver
Of my whole course of love; what drugs, what charms,
What conjuration and what mighty magic,
For such proceeding I am charged withal,
I won his daughter.

		<string>Her father loved me; oft invited me;
Still question&apos;d me the story of my life,
From year to year, the battles, sieges, fortunes,
That I have passed.
I ran it through, even from my boyish days,
To the very moment that he bade me tell it;
Wherein I spake of most disastrous chances,
Of moving accidents by flood and field
Of hair-breadth scapes i&apos; the imminent deadly breach,
Of being taken by the insolent foe
And sold to slavery, of my redemption thence
And portance in my travels&apos; history:
Wherein of antres vast and deserts idle,
Rough quarries, rocks and hills whose heads touch heaven
It was my hint to speak,--such was the process;
And of the Cannibals that each other eat,
The Anthropophagi and men whose heads
Do grow beneath their shoulders. This to hear
Would Desdemona seriously incline:
But still the house-affairs would draw her thence:
Which ever as she could with haste dispatch,
She&apos;ld come again, and with a greedy ear
Devour up my discourse: which I observing,
Took once a pliant hour, and found good means
To draw from her a prayer of earnest heart
That I would all my pilgrimage dilate,
Whereof by parcels she had something heard,
But not intentively: I did consent,
And often did beguile her of her tears,
When I did speak of some distressful stroke
That my youth suffer&apos;d. My story being done,
She gave me for my pains a world of sighs:
She swore, in faith, twas strange, &apos;twas passing strange,
&apos;Twas pitiful, &apos;twas wondrous pitiful:
She wish&apos;d she had not heard it, yet she wish&apos;d
That heaven had made her such a man: she thank&apos;d me,
And bade me, if I had a friend that loved her,
I should but teach him how to tell my story.
And that would woo her. Upon this hint I spake:
She loved me for the dangers I had pass&apos;d,
And I loved her that she did pity them.
This only is the witchcraft I have used:
Here comes the lady; let her witness it.</string>

To put my father in impatient thoughts
By being in his eye. Most gracious duke,
To my unfolding lend your prosperous ear;
And let me find a charter in your voice,
To assist my simpleness.

[What would You, Desdemona?]

That I did love the Moor to live with him,
My downright violence and storm of fortunes
May trumpet to the world: my heart&apos;s subdued
Even to the very quality of my lord:
I saw Othello&apos;s visage in his mind,
And to his honour and his valiant parts
Did I my soul and fortunes consecrate.
So that, dear lords, if I be left behind,
A moth of peace, and he go to the war,
The rites for which I love him are bereft me,
And I a heavy interim shall support
By his dear absence. Let me go with him.</string>

		<string>O villainous! I have looked upon the world for four times seven years; and since I could distinguish betwixt a benefit and an injury, I never found man that knew how to love himself. Ere I would say, I would drown myself for the love of a guinea-hen, I would change my humanity with a baboon.

[What should I do? I confess it is my shame to be so fond; but it is not in my virtue to amend it.]

Virtue! a fig! &apos;tis in ourselves that we are thus or thus. Our bodies are our gardens, to the which our wills are gardeners: so that if we will plant nettles, or sow lettuce, set hyssop and weed up thyme, supply it with one gender of herbs, or distract it with many, either to have it sterile with idleness, or manured with industry, why, the power and corrigible authority of this lies in our wills. If the balance of our lives had not one scale of reason to poise another of sensuality, the blood and baseness of our natures would conduct us to most preposterous conclusions: but we have reason to cool our raging motions, our carnal stings, our unbitted lusts, whereof I take this that you call love to be a sect or scion.

[It cannot be.]

It is merely a lust of the blood and a permission of the will. Come, be a man. Drown thyself! drown cats and blind puppies. I have professed me thy friend and I confess me knit to thy deserving with cables of perdurable toughness; I could never better stead thee than now. Put money in thy purse; follow thou the wars; defeat thy favour with an usurped beard; I say, put money in thy purse. It cannot be that Desdemona should long continue her love to the Moor,-- put money in thy purse,--nor he his to her: it was a violent commencement, and thou shalt see an answerable sequestration:--put but money in thy purse. These Moors are changeable in their wills: fill thy purse with money:--the food that to him now is as luscious as locusts, shall be to him shortly as bitter as coloquintida. She must change for youth: when she is sated with his body, she will find the error of her choice: she must have change, she must: therefore put money in thy purse. If thou wilt needs damn thyself, do it a more delicate way than drowning. Make all the money thou canst: if sanctimony and a frail vow betwixt an erring barbarian and a supersubtle Venetian not too hard for my wits and all the tribe of hell, thou shalt enjoy her; therefore make money. A pox of drowning thyself! it is clean out of the way: seek thou rather to be hanged in compassing thy joy than to be drowned and go without her.

[Wilt thou be fast to my hopes, if I depend on the issue?]

Thou art sure of me:--go, make money:--I have told thee often, and I re-tell thee again and again, I hate the Moor: my cause is hearted; thine hath no less reason. Let us be conjunctive in our revenge against him: if thou canst cuckold him, thou dost thyself a pleasure, me a sport. There are many events in the womb of time which will be delivered. Traverse! go, provide thy money. We will have more of this to-morrow. Adieu.</string>

		<string>Thus do I ever make my fool my purse:
For I mine own gain&apos;d knowledge should profane,
If I would time expend with such a snipe.
But for my sport and profit. I hate the Moor:
And it is thought abroad, that &apos;twixt my sheets
He has done my office: I know not if&apos;t be true;
But I, for mere suspicion in that kind,
Will do as if for surety. He holds me well;
The better shall my purpose work on him.
Cassio&apos;s a proper man: let me see now:
To get his place and to plume up my will
In double knavery--How, how? Let&apos;s see:--
After some time, to abuse Othello&apos;s ear
That he is too familiar with his wife.
He hath a person and a smooth dispose
To be suspected, framed to make women false.
The Moor is of a free and open nature,
That thinks men honest that but seem to be so,
And will as tenderly be led by the nose
As asses are.
I have&apos;t. It is engender&apos;d. Hell and night
Must bring this monstrous birth to the world&apos;s light.</string>

The gutter&apos;d rocks and congregated sands--

Left in the conduct of the bold Iago,
Whose footing here anticipates our thoughts
A se&apos;nnight&apos;s speed. Great Jove, Othello guard,
And swell his sail with thine own powerful breath,
That he may bless this bay with his tall ship,
Make love&apos;s quick pants in Desdemona&apos;s arms,
Give renew&apos;d fire to our extincted spirits
And bring all Cyprus comfort!

Before, behind thee, and on every hand,

Amen to that, sweet powers!

It stops me here; it is too much of joy:
And this, and this, the greatest discords be

How does my old acquaintance of this isle?
Honey, you shall be well desired in Cyprus;
I have found great love amongst them. O my sweet,
I prattle out of fashion, and I dote
In mine own comforts. I prithee, good Iago,
Go to the bay and disembark my coffers:
Bring thou the master to the citadel;
He is a good one, and his worthiness
Does challenge much respect. Come, Desdemona,
Once more, well met at Cyprus.</string>

		<string>Do thou meet me presently at the harbour. Come hither. If thou be&apos;st valiant,-- as, they say, base men being in love have then a nobility in their natures more than is native to them--list me. The lieutenant tonight watches on the court of guard:--first, I must tell thee this--Desdemona is directly in love with him.

[With him! why, &apos;tis not possible.]

Lay thy finger thus, and let thy soul be instructed. Mark me with what violence she first loved the Moor, but for bragging and telling her fantastical lies: and will she love him still for prating? let not thy discreet heart think it. Her eye must be fed; and what delight shall she have to look on the devil? When the blood is made dull with the act of sport, there should be, again to inflame it and to give satiety a fresh appetite, loveliness in favour, sympathy in years, manners and beauties; all which the Moor is defective in: now, for want of these required conveniences, her delicate tenderness will find itself abused, begin to heave the gorge, disrelish and abhor the Moor; very nature will instruct her in it and compel her to some second choice. Now, sir, this granted,--as it is a most pregnant and unforced position--who stands so eminent in the degree of this fortune as Cassio does? a knave very voluble; no further conscionable than in putting on the mere form of civil and humane seeming, for the better compassing of his salt and most hidden loose affection? why, none; why, none: a slipper and subtle knave, a finder of occasions, that has an eye can stamp and counterfeit advantages, though true advantage never present itself; a devilish knave. Besides, the knave is handsome, young, and hath all those requisites in him that folly and green minds look after: a pestilent complete knave; and the woman hath found him already.

[I cannot believe that in her; she&apos;s full of most blessed condition.]

Blessed fig&apos;s-end! the wine she drinks is made of grapes: if she had been blessed, she would never have loved the Moor. Blessed pudding! Didst thou not see her paddle with the palm of his hand? didst not mark that?

[Yes, that I did; but that was but courtesy.]

Lechery, by this hand; an index and obscure prologue to the history of lust and foul thoughts. They met so near with their lips that their breaths embraced together. Villanous thoughts, Roderigo! when these mutualities so marshal the way, hard at hand comes the master and main exercise, the incorporate conclusion, Pish! But, sir, be you ruled by me: I have brought you from Venice. Watch you to-night; for the command, I&apos;ll lay&apos;t upon you. Cassio knows you not. I&apos;ll not be far from you: do you find some occasion to anger Cassio, either by speaking too loud, or tainting his discipline; or from what other course you please, which the time shall more favourably minister.

[Well.]

Sir, he is rash and very sudden in choler, and haply may strike at you: provoke him, that he may; for even out of that will I cause these of Cyprus to mutiny; whose qualification shall come into no true taste again but by the displanting of Cassio. So shall you have a shorter journey to your desires by the means I shall then have to prefer them; and the impediment most profitably removed, without the which there were no expectation of our prosperity.</string>

		<string>That Cassio loves her, I do well believe it;
That she loves him, &apos;tis apt and of great credit:
The Moor, howbeit that I endure him not,
Is of a constant, loving, noble nature,
And I dare think he&apos;ll prove to Desdemona
A most dear husband. Now, I do love her too;
Not out of absolute lust, though peradventure
I stand accountant for as great a sin,
But partly led to diet my revenge,
For that I do suspect the lusty Moor
Hath leap&apos;d into my seat; the thought whereof
Doth, like a poisonous mineral, gnaw my inwards;
And nothing can or shall content my soul
Till I am even&apos;d with him, wife for wife,
Or failing so, yet that I put the Moor
At least into a jealousy so strong
That judgment cannot cure. Which thing to do,
If this poor trash of Venice, whom I trash
For his quick hunting, stand the putting on,
I&apos;ll have our Michael Cassio on the hip,
Abuse him to the Moor in the rank garb--
For I fear Cassio with my night-cap too--
Make the Moor thank me, love me and reward me.
For making him egregiously an ass
And practising upon his peace and quiet
Even to madness. &apos;Tis here, but yet confused:
Knavery&apos;s plain face is never seen tin used.</string>

My blood begins my safer guides to rule;
And passion, having my best judgment collied,
Assays to lead the way: if I once stir,
Or do but lift this arm, the best of you
Shall sink in my rebuke. Give me to know
How this foul rout began, who set it on;
And he that is approved in this offence,
Though he had twinn&apos;d with me, both at a birth,
Shall lose me. What! in a town of war,
Yet wild, the people&apos;s hearts brimful of fear,
To manage private and domestic quarrel,
In night, and on the court and guard of safety!
&apos;Tis monstrous. Iago, who began&apos;t?</string>

Iago recounts the events that led to a brawl in the street, hoping not to implicate Michael Cassio too much; Cassio pursued Roderigo in the street with a sword, and Iago tried to follow; in the end, Cassio and Montano were shouting and fighting in the street.</string>

		<string>Touch me not so near:
I had rather have this tongue cut from my mouth
Than it should do offence to Michael Cassio;
Yet, I persuade myself, to speak the truth
Shall nothing wrong him. Thus it is, general.
Montano and myself being in speech,
There comes a fellow crying out for help:
And Cassio following him with determined sword,
To execute upon him. Sir, this gentleman
Steps in to Cassio, and entreats his pause:
Myself the crying fellow did pursue,
Lest by his clamour--as it so fell out--
The town might fall in fright: he, swift of foot,
Outran my purpose; and I return&apos;d the rather
For that I heard the clink and fall of swords,
And Cassio high in oath; which till to-night
I ne&apos;er might say before. When I came back--
For this was brief--I found them close together,
At blow and thrust; even as again they were
When you yourself did part them.
More of this matter cannot I report:
But men are men; the best sometimes forget:
Though Cassio did some little wrong to him,
As men in rage strike those that wish them best,
Yet surely Cassio, I believe, received
From him that fled some strange indignity,
Which patience could not pass.</string>

Although Iago is manipulating Michael Cassio to get ruin Othello&apos;s life, he remarks that what he has told Cassio is actually sound advice; the only difference is that he, like a devil, is using good advice to a selfish end. He will turn Othello against Desdemona to make him think that his wife is cheating on him with Cassio; her willingness to speak with Cassio will do the rest.</string>

When this advice is free I give and honest,
Probal to thinking and indeed the course
To win the Moor again? For &apos;tis most easy
The inclining Desdemona to subdue
In any honest suit: she&apos;s framed as fruitful
As the free elements. And then for her
To win the Moor--were&apos;t to renounce his baptism,
All seals and symbols of redeemed sin,
His soul is so enfetter&apos;d to her love,
That she may make, unmake, do what she list,
Even as her appetite shall play the god
With his weak function. How am I then a villain
To counsel Cassio to this parallel course,
Directly to his good? Divinity of hell!
When devils will the blackest sins put on,
They do suggest at first with heavenly shows,
As I do now: for whiles this honest fool
Plies Desdemona to repair his fortunes
And she for him pleads strongly to the Moor,
I&apos;ll pour this pestilence into his ear,
That she repeals him for her body&apos;s lust;
And by how much she strives to do him good,
She shall undo her credit with the Moor.
So will I turn her virtue into pitch,
And out of her own goodness make the net
That shall enmesh them all.

Content thyself awhile. By the mass, &apos;tis morning;

		<string>Why, your lieutenant, Cassio. Good my lord,
If I have any grace or power to move you,
His present reconciliation take;
For if he be not one that truly loves you,
That errs in ignorance and not in cunning,
I have no judgment in an honest face:
I prithee, call him back.

[Went he hence now?]

Ay, sooth; so humbled
That he hath left part of his grief with me,
To suffer with him. Good love, call him back.

[Not now, sweet Desdemona; some other time.]

But shall&apos;t be shortly?

[The sooner, sweet, for you.]

Shall&apos;t be to-night at supper?

[No, not to-night.]

To-morrow dinner, then?

[I shall not dine at home;
I meet the captains at the citadel.]

Why, then, to-morrow night; or Tuesday morn;
On Tuesday noon, or night; on Wednesday morn:
I prithee, name the time, but let it not
Exceed three days: in faith, he&apos;s penitent;
And yet his trespass, in our common reason--
Save that, they say, the wars must make examples
Out of their best--is not almost a fault
To incur a private cheque. When shall he come?
Tell me, Othello: I wonder in my soul,
What you would ask me, that I should deny,
Or stand so mammering on. What! Michael Cassio,
That came a-wooing with you, and so many a time,
When I have spoke of you dispraisingly,
Hath ta&apos;en your part; to have so much to do
To bring him in! Trust me, I could do much,--

[Prithee, no more: let him come when he will;
I will deny thee nothing.]

Why, this is not a boon;
&apos;Tis as I should entreat you wear your gloves,
Or feed on nourishing dishes, or keep you warm,
Or sue to you to do a peculiar profit
To your own person: nay, when I have a suit
Wherein I mean to touch your love indeed,
It shall be full of poise and difficult weight
And fearful to be granted.</string>

Shapes faults that are not--that your wisdom yet,

It were not for your quiet nor your good,
Nor for my manhood, honesty, or wisdom,
To let you know my thoughts.

Good name in man and woman, dear my lord,
Is the immediate jewel of their souls:
Who steals my purse steals trash; &apos;tis something, nothing;

But he that filches from me my good name
Robs me of that which not enriches him
And makes me poor indeed.</string>

Farewell the neighing steed, and the shrill trump,

Pride, pomp and circumstance of glorious war!
And, O you mortal engines, whose rude throats
The immortal Jove&apos;s dead clamours counterfeit,
Farewell! Othello&apos;s occupation&apos;s gone!

Villain, be sure thou prove my love a whore,
Be sure of it; give me the ocular proof:
Or by the worth of man&apos;s eternal soul,

If thou dost slander her and torture me,
Never pray more; abandon all remorse;
On horror&apos;s head horrors accumulate;
Do deeds to make heaven weep, all earth amazed;
For nothing canst thou to damnation add
Greater than that.</string>

Iago regrets making Othello obsessed with Desdemona&apos;s apparent affair with Michael Cassio, and wonders how he it could be proven short of watching them sleep together, which they would never do openly. Iago offers circumstantial evidence: he heard Cassio in his sleep crying out for Desdemona and was groped by him.</string>

		<string>I see, sir, you are eaten up with passion:
I do repent me that I put it to you.
You would be satisfied?

[Would! nay, I will.]

And may: but, how? how satisfied, my lord?
Would you, the supervisor, grossly gape on--
Behold her topp&apos;d?

[Death and damnation! O!]

It were a tedious difficulty, I think,
To bring them to that prospect: damn them then,
If ever mortal eyes do see them bolster
More than their own! What then? how then?
What shall I say? Where&apos;s satisfaction?
It is impossible you should see this,
Were they as prime as goats, as hot as monkeys,
As salt as wolves in pride, and fools as gross
As ignorance made drunk. But yet, I say,
If imputation and strong circumstances,
Which lead directly to the door of truth,
Will give you satisfaction, you may have&apos;t.

[Give me a living reason she&apos;s disloyal.]

I do not like the office:
But, sith I am enter&apos;d in this cause so far,
Prick&apos;d to&apos;t by foolish honesty and love,
I will go on. I lay with Cassio lately;
And, being troubled with a raging tooth,
I could not sleep.
There are a kind of men so loose of soul,
That in their sleeps will mutter their affairs:
One of this kind is Cassio:
In sleep I heard him say &apos;Sweet Desdemona,
Let us be wary, let us hide our loves;&apos;
And then, sir, would he gripe and wring my hand,
Cry &apos;O sweet creature!&apos; and then kiss me hard,
As if he pluck&apos;d up kisses by the roots
That grew upon my lips: then laid his leg
Over my thigh, and sigh&apos;d, and kiss&apos;d; and then
Cried &apos;Cursed fate that gave thee to the Moor!&apos;</string>

		<string>That is a fault.
That handkerchief
Did an Egyptian to my mother give;
She was a charmer, and could almost read
The thoughts of people: she told her, while
she kept it,
&apos;Twould make her amiable and subdue my father
Entirely to her love, but if she lost it
Or made gift of it, my father&apos;s eye
Should hold her loathed and his spirits should hunt
After new fancies: she, dying, gave it me;
And bid me, when my fate would have me wive,
To give it her. I did so: and take heed on&apos;t;
Make it a darling like your precious eye;
To lose&apos;t or give&apos;t away were such perdition
As nothing else could match.

[Is&apos;t possible?]

&apos;Tis true: there&apos;s magic in the web of it:
A sibyl, that had number&apos;d in the world
The sun to course two hundred compasses,
In her prophetic fury sew&apos;d the work;
The worms were hallow&apos;d that did breed the silk;
And it was dyed in mummy which the skilful
Conserved of maidens&apos; hearts.

[Indeed! is&apos;t true?]

Most veritable; therefore look to&apos;t well.</string>

May draw with you: there&apos;s millions now alive
That nightly lie in those unproper beds
Which they dare swear peculiar: your case is better.
O, &apos;tis the spite of hell, the fiend&apos;s arch-mock,
To lip a wanton in a secure couch,
And to suppose her chaste! No, let me know;
And knowing what I am, I know what she shall be.

[O, thou art wise; &apos;tis certain.]

Stand you awhile apart;
Confine yourself but in a patient list.
Whilst you were here o&apos;erwhelmed with your grief--
A passion most unsuiting such a man--
Cassio came hither: I shifted him away,
And laid good &apos;scuse upon your ecstasy,
Bade him anon return and here speak with me;
The which he promised. Do but encave yourself,
And mark the fleers, the gibes, and notable scorns,
That dwell in every region of his face;
For I will make him tell the tale anew,
Where, how, how oft, how long ago, and when
He hath, and is again to cope your wife:
I say, but mark his gesture. Marry, patience;
Or I shall say you are all in all in spleen,
And nothing of a man.</string>

All kinds of sores and shames on my bare head.

Given to captivity me and my utmost hopes,

But there, where I have garner&apos;d up my heart,
Where either I must live, or bear no life;

Good friend, go to him; for, by this light of heaven,

Or that mine eyes, mine ears, or any sense,
Delighted them in any other form;
Or that I do not yet, and ever did.
And ever will--though he do shake me off
To beggarly divorcement--love him dearly,
Comfort forswear me! Unkindness may do much;
And his unkindness may defeat my life,
But never taint my love. I cannot say &apos;whore:&apos;

To do the act that might the addition earn
Not the world&apos;s mass of vanity could make me.</string>

[Beshrew me, if I would do such a wrong
For the whole world.]

Why the wrong is but a wrong i&apos; the world: and having the world for your labour, tis a wrong in your own world, and you might quickly make it right.

[I do not think there is any such woman.]

Yes, a dozen; and as many to the vantage as would store the world they played for.
But I do think it is their husbands&apos; faults
If wives do fall: say that they slack their duties,
And pour our treasures into foreign laps,
Or else break out in peevish jealousies,
Throwing restraint upon us; or say they strike us,
Or scant our former having in despite;
Why, we have galls, and though we have some grace,
Yet have we some revenge. Let husbands know
Their wives have sense like them: they see and smell
And have their palates both for sweet and sour,
As husbands have. What is it that they do
When they change us for others? Is it sport?
I think it is: and doth affection breed it?
I think it doth: is&apos;t frailty that thus errs?
It is so too: and have not we affections,
Desires for sport, and frailty, as men have?
Then let them use us well: else let them know,
The ills we do, their ills instruct us so.</string>

Othello mourns over the body of Desdemona, whom he now realizes was never unfaithful to him. At the start, he gets a sword to pursue Iago, whose lies led to Desdemona&apos;s death, before he is distracted by grief. He may be speaking at first to Iago, Graziano, death, fate, or himself. &quot;Compt&quot; refers to the biblical Judgment Day.</string>

		<string>Behold, I have a weapon;
A better never did itself sustain
Upon a soldier&apos;s thigh: I have seen the day,
That, with this little arm and this good sword,
I have made my way through more impediments
Than twenty times your stop: but, O vain boast!
Who can control his fate? &apos;tis not so now.
Be not afraid, though you do see me weapon&apos;d;
Here is my journey&apos;s end, here is my butt,
And very sea-mark of my utmost sail.
Do you go back dismay&apos;d? &apos;tis a lost fear;
Man but a rush against Othello&apos;s breast,
And he retires. Where should Othello go?
Now, how dost thou look now? O ill-starr&apos;d wench!
Pale as thy smock! when we shall meet at compt,
This look of thine will hurl my soul from heaven,
And fiends will snatch at it. Cold, cold, my girl!
Even like thy chastity. O cursed slave!
Whip me, ye devils,
From the possession of this heavenly sight!
Blow me about in winds! roast me in sulphur!
Wash me in steep-down gulfs of liquid fire!
O Desdemona! Desdemona! dead!
Oh! Oh! Oh!</string>

I have done the state some service, and they know&apos;t.
No more of that. I pray you, in your letters,
When you shall these unlucky deeds relate,
Speak of me as I am; nothing extenuate,
Nor set down aught in malice: then must you speak
Of one that loved not wisely but too well;
Of one not easily jealous, but being wrought
Perplex&apos;d in the extreme; of one whose hand,
Like the base Indian, threw a pearl away
Richer than all his tribe; of one whose subdued eyes,
Albeit unused to the melting mood,
Drop tears as fast as the Arabian trees
Their medicinal gum. Set you down this;
And say besides, that in Aleppo once,
Where a malignant and a turban&apos;d Turk
Beat a Venetian and traduced the state,
I took by the throat the circumcised dog,
And smote him, thus.</string>

		<string>Two households, both alike in dignity,
In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,
From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,
Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.
From forth the fatal loins of these two foes
A pair of star-cross&apos;d lovers take their life;
Whose misadventured piteous overthrows
Do with their death bury their parents&apos; strife.
The fearful passage of their death-mark&apos;d love,
And the continuance of their parents&apos; rage,
Which, but their children&apos;s end, nought could remove,
Is now the two hours&apos; traffic of our stage;
The which if you with patient ears attend,
What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.</string>

That quench the fire of your pernicious rage
With purple fountains issuing from your veins,
On pain of torture, from those bloody hands
Throw your mistemper&apos;d weapons to the ground,
And hear the sentence of your moved prince.
Three civil brawls, bred of an airy word,
By thee, old Capulet, and Montague,
Have thrice disturb&apos;d the quiet of our streets,
And made Verona&apos;s ancient citizens
Cast by their grave beseeming ornaments,
To wield old partisans, in hands as old,
Canker&apos;d with peace, to part your canker&apos;d hate:
If ever you disturb our streets again,
Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace.
For this time, all the rest depart away:
You Capulet; shall go along with me:
And, Montague, come you this afternoon,
To know our further pleasure in this case,
To old Free-town, our common judgment-place.
Once more, on pain of death, all men depart.</string>

		<string>Here were the servants of your adversary,
And yours, close fighting ere I did approach:
I drew to part them: in the instant came
The fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepared,
Which, as he breathed defiance to my ears,
He swung about his head and cut the winds,
Who nothing hurt withal hiss&apos;d him in scorn:
While we were interchanging thrusts and blows,
Came more and more and fought on part and part,
Till the prince came, who parted either part.

[O, where is Romeo? saw you him to-day?
Right glad I am he was not at this fray.]

Madam, an hour before the worshipp&apos;d sun
Peer&apos;d forth the golden window of the east,
A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad;
Where, underneath the grove of sycamore
That westward rooteth from the city&apos;s side,
So early walking did I see your son:
Towards him I made, but he was ware of me
And stole into the covert of the wood:
I, measuring his affections by my own,
That most are busied when they&apos;re most alone,
Pursued my humour not pursuing his,
And gladly shunn&apos;d who gladly fled from me.</string>

		<string>Many a morning hath he there been seen,
With tears augmenting the fresh morning dew.
Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs;
But all so soon as the all-cheering sun
Should in the furthest east begin to draw
The shady curtains from Aurora&apos;s bed,
Away from the light steals home my heavy son,
And private in his chamber pens himself,
Shuts up his windows, locks far daylight out
And makes himself an artificial night:
Black and portentous must this humour prove,
Unless good counsel may the cause remove.

[My noble uncle, do you know the cause?]

I neither know it nor can learn of him.

[Have you importuned him by any means?]

Both by myself and many other friends:
But he, his own affections&apos; counsellor,
Is to himself--I will not say how true--
But to himself so secret and so close,
So far from sounding and discovery,
As is the bud bit with an envious worm,
Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air,
Or dedicate his beauty to the sun.
Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow.
We would as willingly give cure as know.</string>

		<string>This forenam&apos;d maid hath yet in her the continuance

like an impediment in the current, made it more

requiring with a plausible obedience; agree with 
his demands to the point; only refer yourself to
this advantage, first, that your stay with him may
not be long; that the time may have all shadow and
silence in it; and the place answer to convenience.
This being granted in course,—and now follows

your appointment, go in your place; if the encounter
acknowledge itself hereafter, it may compel him to
her recompense: and here, by this, is your brother
saved, your honour untainted, the poor Mariana

[Alas, that love, so gentle in his view,
Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!]

Alas, that love, whose view is muffled still,
Should, without eyes, see pathways to his will!
Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here?
Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all.
Here&apos;s much to do with hate, but more with love.
Why, then, O brawling love! O loving hate!
O any thing, of nothing first create!
O heavy lightness! serious vanity!
Mis-shapen chaos of well-seeming forms!
Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire,
sick health!
Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is!
This love feel I, that feel no love in this.
Dost thou not laugh?

[No, coz, I rather weep.]

Good heart, at what?

[At thy good heart&apos;s oppression.]

Why, such is love&apos;s transgression.
Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast,
Which thou wilt propagate, to have it prest
With more of thine: this love that thou hast shown
Doth add more grief to too much of mine own.
Love is a smoke raised with the fume of sighs;
Being purged, a fire sparkling in lovers&apos; eyes;
Being vex&apos;d a sea nourish&apos;d with lovers&apos; tears:
What is it else? a madness most discreet,
A choking gall and a preserving sweet.
Farewell, my coz.</string>

Earth-treading stars that make dark heaven light:

Of limping winter treads, even such delight

Inherit at my house; hear all, all see,
And like her most whose merit most shall be:

May stand in number, though in reckoning none,

[She&apos;s not fourteen.]

I&apos;ll lay fourteen of my teeth,--
And yet, to my teeth be it spoken, I have but four--
She is not fourteen. How long is it now
To Lammas-tide?

[A fortnight and odd days.]

Even or odd, of all days in the year,
Come Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen.
Susan and she--God rest all Christian souls!--
Were of an age: well, Susan is with God;
She was too good for me: but, as I said,
On Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen;
That shall she, marry; I remember it well.
&apos;Tis since the earthquake now eleven years;
And she was wean&apos;d,--I never shall forget it,--
Of all the days of the year, upon that day:
For I had then laid wormwood to my dug,
Sitting in the sun under the dove-house wall;
My lord and you were then at Mantua:--
Nay, I do bear a brain:--but, as I said,
When it did taste the wormwood on the nipple
Of my dug and felt it bitter, pretty fool,
To see it tetchy and fall out with the dug!
Shake quoth the dove-house: &apos;twas no need, I trow,
To bid me trudge:
And since that time it is eleven years;
For then she could stand alone; nay, by the rood,
She could have run and waddled all about;
For even the day before, she broke her brow:
And then my husband--God be with his soul!
A&apos; was a merry man--took up the child:
&apos;Yea,&apos; quoth he, &apos;dost thou fall upon thy face?
Thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit;
Wilt thou not, Jule?&apos; and, by my holidame,
The pretty wretch left crying and said &apos;Ay.&apos;
To see, now, how a jest shall come about!
I warrant, an I should live a thousand years,
I never should forget it: &apos;Wilt thou not, Jule?&apos; quoth he;
And, pretty fool, it stinted and said &apos;Ay.&apos;

[Enough of this; I pray thee, hold thy peace.]

Yes, madam: yet I cannot choose but laugh,
To think it should leave crying and say &apos;Ay.&apos;
And yet, I warrant, it had upon its brow
A bump as big as a young cockerel&apos;s stone;
A parlous knock; and it cried bitterly:
&apos;Yea,&apos; quoth my husband,&apos;fall&apos;st upon thy face?
Thou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age;
Wilt thou not, Jule?&apos; it stinted and said &apos;Ay.&apos;</string>

That you are now a maid. Thus then in brief:
The valiant Paris seeks you for his love.

What say you? can you love the gentleman?
This night you shall behold him at our feast;
Read o&apos;er the volume of young Paris&apos; face,
And find delight writ there with beauty&apos;s pen;
Examine every married lineament,
And see how one another lends content
And what obscured in this fair volume lies
Find written in the margent of his eyes.
This precious book of love, this unbound lover,
To beautify him, only lacks a cover:
The fish lives in the sea, and &apos;tis much pride
For fair without the fair within to hide:
That book in many&apos;s eyes doth share the glory,
That in gold clasps locks in the golden story;
So shall you share all that he doth possess,

		<string>O, then, I see Queen Mab hath been with you.
She is the fairies&apos; midwife, and she comes
In shape no bigger than an agate-stone
On the fore-finger of an alderman,
Drawn with a team of little atomies
Athwart men&apos;s noses as they lie asleep;
Her wagon-spokes made of long spiders&apos; legs,
The cover of the wings of grasshoppers,
The traces of the smallest spider&apos;s web,
The collars of the moonshine&apos;s watery beams,
Her whip of cricket&apos;s bone, the lash of film,
Her wagoner a small grey-coated gnat,
Not so big as a round little worm
Prick&apos;d from the lazy finger of a maid;
Her chariot is an empty hazel-nut
Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub,
Time out o&apos; mind the fairies&apos; coachmakers.
And in this state she gallops night by night
Through lovers&apos; brains, and then they dream of love;
O&apos;er courtiers&apos; knees, that dream on court&apos;sies straight,
O&apos;er lawyers&apos; fingers, who straight dream on fees,
O&apos;er ladies &apos; lips, who straight on kisses dream,
Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues,
Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are:
Sometime she gallops o&apos;er a courtier&apos;s nose,
And then dreams he of smelling out a suit;
And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig&apos;s tail
Tickling a parson&apos;s nose as a&apos; lies asleep,
Then dreams, he of another benefice:
Sometime she driveth o&apos;er a soldier&apos;s neck,
And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,
Of breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades,
Of healths five-fathom deep; and then anon
Drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes,
And being thus frighted swears a prayer or two
And sleeps again. This is that very Mab
That plats the manes of horses in the night,
And bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish hairs,
Which once untangled, much misfortune bodes:
This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs,
That presses them and learns them first to bear,
Making them women of good carriage:
This is she--

[Peace, peace, Mercutio, peace!
Thou talk&apos;st of nothing.]

True, I talk of dreams,
Which are the children of an idle brain,
Begot of nothing but vain fantasy,
Which is as thin of substance as the air
And more inconstant than the wind, who wooes
Even now the frozen bosom of the north,
And, being anger&apos;d, puffs away from thence,
Turning his face to the dew-dropping south.</string>

Ah ha, my mistresses! which of you all
Will now deny to dance? she that makes dainty,

Welcome, gentlemen! I have seen the day

A whispering tale in a fair lady&apos;s ear,
Such as would please: &apos;tis gone, &apos;tis gone, &apos;tis gone:
You are welcome, gentlemen! come, musicians, play.
A hall, a hall! give room! and foot it, girls.

More light, you knaves; and turn the tables up,
And quench the fire, the room is grown too hot.
Ah, sirrah, this unlook&apos;d-for sport comes well.
Nay, sit, nay, sit, good cousin Capulet;
For you and I are past our dancing days:
How long is&apos;t now since last yourself and I
Were in a mask?

What, man! &apos;tis not so much, &apos;tis not so much:

Come pentecost as quickly as it will,
Some five and twenty years; and then we mask&apos;d.</string>

And, to say truth, Verona brags of him
To be a virtuous and well-govern&apos;d youth:
I would not for the wealth of all the town

Therefore be patient, take no note of him:
It is my will, the which if thou respect,
Show a fair presence and put off these frowns,
And ill-beseeming semblance for a feast.

What, goodman boy! I say, he shall: go to;
Am I the master here, or you? go to.
You&apos;ll not endure him! God shall mend my soul!

You will set cock-a-hoop! you&apos;ll be the man!

Go to, go to;
You are a saucy boy: is&apos;t so, indeed?
This trick may chance to scathe you, I know what:
You must contrary me! marry, &apos;tis time.

		<string>Now old desire doth in his death-bed lie,
And young affection gapes to be his heir;
That fair for which love groan&apos;d for and would die,
With tender Juliet match&apos;d, is now not fair.
Now Romeo is beloved and loves again,
Alike betwitched by the charm of looks,
But to his foe supposed he must complain,
And she steal love&apos;s sweet bait from fearful hooks:
Being held a foe, he may not have access
To breathe such vows as lovers use to swear;
And she as much in love, her means much less
To meet her new-beloved any where:
But passion lends them power, time means, to meet
Tempering extremities with extreme sweet.</string>

		<string>He is wise;
And, on my lie, hath stol&apos;n him home to bed.

[He ran this way, and leap&apos;d this orchard wall:
Call, good Mercutio.]

Nay, I&apos;ll conjure too.
Romeo! humours! madman! passion! lover!
Appear thou in the likeness of a sigh:
Speak but one rhyme, and I am satisfied;
Cry but &apos;Ay me!&apos; pronounce but &apos;love&apos; and &apos;dove;&apos;
Speak to my gossip Venus one fair word,
One nick-name for her purblind son and heir,
Young Adam Cupid, he that shot so trim,
When King Cophetua loved the beggar-maid!
He heareth not, he stirreth not, he moveth not;
The ape is dead, and I must conjure him.
I conjure thee by Rosaline&apos;s bright eyes,
By her high forehead and her scarlet lip,
By her fine foot, straight leg and quivering thigh
And the demesnes that there adjacent lie,
That in thy likeness thou appear to us!

[And if he hear thee, thou wilt anger him.]

This cannot anger him: &apos;twould anger him
To raise a spirit in his mistress&apos; circle
Of some strange nature, letting it there stand
Till she had laid it and conjured it down;
That were some spite: my invocation
Is fair and honest, and in his mistres s&apos; name
I conjure only but to raise up him.

[Come, he hath hid himself among these trees,
To be consorted with the humorous night:
Blind is his love and best befits the dark.]

If love be blind, love cannot hit the mark.
Now will he sit under a medlar tree,
And wish his mistress were that kind of fruit
As maids call medlars, when they laugh alone.
Romeo, that she were, O, that she were
An open et caetera, thou a poperin pear!
Romeo, good night: I&apos;ll to my truckle-bed;
This field-bed is too cold for me to sleep:
Come, shall we go?</string>

It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.
Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon,
Who is already sick and pale with grief,
That thou her maid art far more fair than she:
Be not her maid, since she is envious;
Her vestal livery is but sick and green
And none but fools do wear it; cast it off.
It is my lady, O, it is my love!
O, that she knew she were!
She speaks yet she says nothing: what of that?
Her eye discourses; I will answer it.
I am too bold, &apos;tis not to me she speaks:
Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven,
Having some business, do entreat her eyes
To twinkle in their spheres till they return.
What if her eyes were there, they in her head?
The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars,
As daylight doth a lamp; her eyes in heaven
Would through the airy region stream so bright
That birds would sing and think it were not night.
See, how she leans her cheek upon her hand!
O, that I were a glove upon that hand,
That I might touch that cheek!</string>

		<string>The grey-eyed morn smiles on the frowning night,
Chequering the eastern clouds with streaks of light,
And flecked darkness like a drunkard reels
From forth day&apos;s path and Titan&apos;s fiery wheels:
Now, ere the sun advance his burning eye,
The day to cheer and night&apos;s dank dew to dry,
I must up-fill this osier cage of ours
With baleful weeds and precious-juiced flowers.
The earth that&apos;s nature&apos;s mother is her tomb;
What is her burying grave that is her womb,
And from her womb children of divers kind
We sucking on her natural bosom find,
Many for many virtues excellent,
None but for some and yet all different.
O, mickle is the powerful grace that lies
In herbs, plants, stones, and their true qualities:
For nought so vile that on the earth doth live
But to the earth some special good doth give,
Nor aught so good but strain&apos;d from that fair use
Revolts from true birth, stumbling on abuse:
Virtue itself turns vice, being misapplied;
And vice sometimes by action dignified.
Within the infant rind of this small flower
Poison hath residence and medicine power:
For this, being smelt, with that part cheers each part;
Being tasted, slays all senses with the heart.
Two such opposed kings encamp them still
In man as well as herbs, grace and rude will;
And where the worser is predominant,
Full soon the canker death eats up that plant.</string>

Thy old groans ring yet in my ancient ears;
Lo, here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit
Of an old tear that is not wash&apos;d off yet:

Thou and these woes were all for Rosaline:

Juliet is impatient for her nurse to return from delivering a message to Romeo, saying that a messenger of love should be quick. When the nurse returns, she asks her what she&apos;s heard from Romeo, worried that it might be bad news but hoping that it&apos;s good. </string>

		<string>The clock struck nine when I did send the nurse;
In half an hour she promised to return.
Perchance she cannot meet him: that&apos;s not so.
O, she is lame! love&apos;s heralds should be thoughts,
Which ten times faster glide than the sun&apos;s beams,
Driving back shadows over louring hills:
Therefore do nimble-pinion&apos;d doves draw love,
And therefore hath the wind-swift Cupid wings.
Now is the sun upon the highmost hill
Of this day&apos;s journey, and from nine till twelve
Is three long hours, yet she is not come.
Had she affections and warm youthful blood,
She would be as swift in motion as a ball;
My words would bandy her to my sweet love,
And his to me:
But old folks, many feign as they were dead;
Unwieldy, slow, heavy and pale as lead.
O God, she comes!

[Enter Nurse and PETER]

O honey nurse, what news?
Hast thou met with him? Send thy man away.

[Peter, stay at the gate.]
[exit PETER]

Now, good sweet nurse,--O Lord, why look&apos;st thou sad?
Though news be sad, yet tell them merrily;
If good, thou shamest the music of sweet news
By playing it to me with so sour a face.

[I am a-weary, give me leave awhile:
Fie, how my bones ache! what a jaunt have I had!]

I would thou hadst my bones, and I thy news:
Nay, come, I pray thee, speak; good, good nurse, speak.</string>

When Benvolio warns him that the Capulets may find and fight with them, Mercutio calls Benvolio a hypocrite, saying that Benvolio is short-tempered and plays at being a pacifist, but would start a fight for any simple reason. It&apos;s unclear of Mercutio is not actually describing himself.</string>

Come, come, thou art as hot a Jack in thy mood as any in Italy, and as soon moved to be moody, and as soon moody to be moved.

Nay, an there were two such, we should have none shortly, for one would kill the other.

		<string>Tybalt, here slain, whom Romeo&apos;s hand did slay;
Romeo that spoke him fair, bade him bethink
How nice the quarrel was, and urged withal
Your high displeasure: all this uttered
With gentle breath, calm look, knees humbly bow&apos;d,
Could not take truce with the unruly spleen
Of Tybalt deaf to peace, but that he tilts
With piercing steel at bold Mercutio&apos;s breast,
Who all as hot, turns deadly point to point,
And, with a martial scorn, with one hand beats
Cold death aside, and with the other sends
It back to Tybalt, whose dexterity,
Retorts it: Romeo he cries aloud,
&apos;Hold, friends! friends, part!&apos; and, swifter than
his tongue,
His agile arm beats down their fatal points,
And &apos;twixt them rushes; underneath whose arm
An envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life
Of stout Mercutio, and then Tybalt fled;
But by and by comes back to Romeo,
Who had but newly entertain&apos;d revenge,
And to &apos;t they go like lightning, for, ere I
Could draw to part them, was stout Tybalt slain.
And, as he fell, did Romeo turn and fly.
This is the truth, or let Benvolio die.</string>

Towards Phoebus&apos; lodging: such a wagoner
As Phaethon would whip you to the west,
And bring in cloudy night immediately.
Spread thy close curtain, love-performing night,

Leap to these arms, untalk&apos;d of and unseen.
Lovers can see to do their amorous rites
By their own beauties; or, if love be blind,
It best agrees with night. Come, civil night,
Thou sober-suited matron, all in black,
And learn me how to lose a winning match,
Play&apos;d for a pair of stainless maidenhoods:
Hood my unmann&apos;d blood, bating in my cheeks,
With thy black mantle; till strange love, grown bold,
Think true love acted simple modesty.
Come, night; come, Romeo; come, thou day in night;
For thou wilt lie upon the wings of night
Whiter than new snow on a raven&apos;s back.
Come, gentle night, come, loving, black-brow&apos;d night,
Give me my Romeo; and, when he shall die,
Take him and cut him out in little stars,
And he will make the face of heaven so fine
That all the world will be in love with night
And pay no worship to the garish sun.
O, I have bought the mansion of a love,
But not possess&apos;d it, and, though I am sold,
Not yet enjoy&apos;d: so tedious is this day
As is the night before some festival
To an impatient child that hath new robes
And may not wear them. O, here comes my nurse,
And she brings news; and every tongue that speaks
But Romeo&apos;s name speaks heavenly eloquence.</string>

But with a rear-ward following Tybalt&apos;s death,

Is father, mother, Tybalt, Romeo, Juliet,
All slain, all dead. &apos;Romeo is banished!&apos;
There is no end, no limit, measure, bound,
In that word&apos;s death; no words can that woe sound.

But purgatory, torture, hell itself.
Hence-banished is banish&apos;d from the world,
And world&apos;s exile is death: then banished,
Is death mis-term&apos;d: calling death banishment,
Thou cutt&apos;st my head off with a golden axe,
And smilest upon the stroke that murders me.

[O deadly sin! O rude unthankfulness!
Thy fault our law calls death; but the kind prince,
Taking thy part, hath rush&apos;d aside the law,
And turn&apos;d that black word death to banishment:
This is dear mercy, and thou seest it not.]

&apos;Tis torture, and not mercy: heaven is here,
Where Juliet lives; and every cat and dog
And little mouse, every unworthy thing,
Live here in heaven and may look on her;
But Romeo may not: more validity,
More honourable state, more courtship lives
In carrion-flies than Romeo: they my seize
On the white wonder of dear Juliet&apos;s hand
And steal immortal blessing from her lips,
Who even in pure and vestal modesty,
Still blush, as thinking their own kisses sin;
But Romeo may not; he is banished:
Flies may do this, but I from this must fly:
They are free men, but I am banished.
And say&apos;st thou yet that exile is not death?
Hadst thou no poison mix&apos;d, no sharp-ground knife,
No sudden mean of death, though ne&apos;er so mean,
But &apos;banished&apos; to kill me?--&apos;banished&apos;?

Friar Lawrence condemns Romeo for trying to take his own life, accusing him of being something other than a man, and throwing away that which God has given him: a mind, a body, a soul. He reminds Romeo that his death would kill Juliet, too, and that he should be glad happy that he still has his life after fighting Tybalt. He tells Romeo to see Juliet one more time before leaving for Mantua. He assures Romeo that his friends will be able to have is exile anulled, and tells the nurse to send the message to Juliet.</string>

Art thou a man? thy form cries out thou art:
Thy tears are womanish; thy wild acts denote
The unreasonable fury of a beast:
Unseemly woman in a seeming man!
Or ill-beseeming beast in seeming both!
Thou hast amazed me: by my holy order,
I thought thy disposition better temper&apos;d.
Hast thou slain Tybalt? wilt thou slay thyself?
And stay thy lady too that lives in thee,
By doing damned hate upon thyself?
Why rail&apos;st thou on thy birth, the heaven, and earth?
Since birth, and heaven, and earth, all three do meet
In thee at once; which thou at once wouldst lose.
Fie, fie, thou shamest thy shape, thy love, thy wit;
Which, like a usurer, abound&apos;st in all,
And usest none in that true use indeed
Which should bedeck thy shape, thy love, thy wit:
Thy noble shape is but a form of wax,
Digressing from the valour of a man;
Thy dear love sworn but hollow perjury,
Killing that love which thou hast vow&apos;d to cherish;
Thy wit, that ornament to shape and love,
Misshapen in the conduct of them both,
Like powder in a skitless soldier&apos;s flask,
Is set afire by thine own ignorance,
And thou dismember&apos;d with thine own defence.
What, rouse thee, man! thy Juliet is alive,
For whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead;
There art thou happy: Tybalt would kill thee,
But thou slew&apos;st Tybalt; there are thou happy too:
The law that threaten&apos;d death becomes thy friend
And turns it to exile; there art thou happy:
A pack of blessings lights up upon thy back;
Happiness courts thee in her best array;
But, like a misbehaved and sullen wench,
Thou pout&apos;st upon thy fortune and thy love:
Take heed, take heed, for such die miserable.
Go, get thee to thy love, as was decreed,
Ascend her chamber, hence and comfort her:
But look thou stay not till the watch be set,
For then thou canst not pass to Mantua;
Where thou shalt live, till we can find a time
To blaze your marriage, reconcile your friends,
Beg pardon of the prince, and call thee back
With twenty hundred thousand times more joy
Than thou went&apos;st forth in lamentation.
Go before, nurse: commend me to thy lady;
And bid her hasten all the house to bed,
Which heavy sorrow makes them apt unto:
Romeo is coming.</string>

		<string>Things have fall&apos;n out, sir, so unluckily,
That we have had no time to move our daughter:
Look you, she loved her kinsman Tybalt dearly,
And so did I:--Well, we were born to die.
&apos;Tis very late, she&apos;ll not come down to-night:
I promise you, but for your company,
I would have been a-bed an hour ago.

[These times of woe afford no time to woo.
Madam, good night: commend me to your daughter.]

[I will, and know her mind early to-morrow;
To-night she is mew&apos;d up to her heaviness.]

Sir Paris, I will make a desperate tender
Of my child&apos;s love: I think she will be ruled
In all respects by me; nay, more, I doubt it not.
Wife, go you to her ere you go to bed;
Acquaint her here of my son Paris&apos; love;
And bid her, mark you me, on Wednesday next--
But, soft! what day is this?

[Monday, my lord.]

Monday! ha, ha! Well, Wednesday is too soon,
O&apos; Thursday let it be: o&apos; Thursday, tell her,
She shall be married to this noble earl.
Will you be ready? do you like this haste?
We&apos;ll keep no great ado,--a friend or two;
For, hark you, Tybalt being slain so late,
It may be thought we held him carelessly,
Being our kinsman, if we revel much:
Therefore we&apos;ll have some half a dozen friends,
And there an end. But what say you to Thursday?

[My lord, I would that Thursday were to-morrow.]

Well get you gone: o&apos; Thursday be it, then.
Go you to Juliet ere you go to bed,
Prepare her, wife, against this wedding-day.
Farewell, my lord. Light to my chamber, ho!
Afore me! it is so very very late,
That we may call it early by and by.
Good night.</string>

On hearing from Lady Capulet that Juliet will not marry Paris, Capulet is in disbelief, and wonders how Juliet could be so ungrateful. When Juliet insists that she is grateful, Capulet accuses her of being illogical and confounding, and demands that she marry Paris, even if he has to drag her to the church. He tells Lady Capulet that he regrets having Juliet as a child.</string>

Hear me with patience but to speak a word.]


Hang thee, young baggage! disobedient wretch!

Or never after look me in the face:
Speak not, reply not, do not answer me;

That God had lent us but this only child;
But now I see this one is one too much,
And that we have a curse in having her:

Romeo is banish&apos;d; and all the world to nothing,
That he dares ne&apos;er come back to challenge you;
Or, if he do, it needs must be by stealth.
Then, since the case so stands as now it doth,
I think it best you married with the county.
O, he&apos;s a lovely gentleman!
Romeo&apos;s a dishclout to him: an eagle, madam,
Hath not so green, so quick, so fair an eye
As Paris hath. Beshrew my very heart,
I think you are happy in this second match,
For it excels your first: or if it did not,
Your first is dead; or &apos;twere as good he were,
As living here and you no use of him.

With ransom of such shame. Would yet he had lived!

When he doesn&apos;t have any, Juliet reveals that she is willing to kill herself if someone as wise as the friar has no other solution. When the friar asks if Juliet is brave enough to try a desperate option, she enumerates every frightening thing she would do to see Romeo again.</string>

		<string>O shut the door! and when thou hast done so,
Come weep with me; past hope, past cure, past help!

[Ah, Juliet, I already know thy grief;
It strains me past the compass of my wits:
I hear thou must, and nothing may prorogue it,
On Thursday next be married to this county.]

Tell me not, friar, that thou hear&apos;st of this,
Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it:
If, in thy wisdom, thou canst give no help,
Do thou but call my resolution wise,
And with this knife I&apos;ll help it presently.
God join&apos;d my heart and Romeo&apos;s, thou our hands;
And ere this hand, by thee to Romeo seal&apos;d,
Shall be the label to another deed,
Or my true heart with treacherous revolt
Turn to another, this shall slay them both:
Therefore, out of thy long-experienced time,
Give me some present counsel, or, behold,
&apos;Twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife
Shall play the umpire, arbitrating that
Which the commission of thy years and art
Could to no issue of true honour bring.
Be not so long to speak; I long to die,
If what thou speak&apos;st speak not of remedy.

[Hold, daughter: I do spy a kind of hope,
Which craves as desperate an execution.
As that is desperate which we would prevent.
If, rather than to marry County Paris,
Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself,
Then is it likely thou wilt undertake
A thing like death to chide away this shame,
That copest with death himself to scape from it:
And, if thou darest, I&apos;ll give thee remedy.]

O, bid me leap, rather than marry Paris,
From off the battlements of yonder tower;
Or walk in thievish ways; or bid me lurk
Where serpents are; chain me with roaring bears;
Or shut me nightly in a charnel-house,
O&apos;er-cover&apos;d quite with dead men&apos;s rattling bones,
With reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls;
Or bid me go into a new-made grave
And hide me with a dead man in his shroud;
Things that, to hear them told, have made me tremble;
And I will do it without fear or doubt,
To live an unstain&apos;d wife to my sweet love.</string>

To marry Paris: Wednesday is to-morrow:
To-morrow night look that thou lie alone;
Let not thy nurse lie with thee in thy chamber:
Take thou this vial, being then in bed,
And this distilled liquor drink thou off;
When presently through all thy veins shall run
A cold and drowsy humour, for no pulse
Shall keep his native progress, but surcease:
No warmth, no breath, shall testify thou livest;
The roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade
To paly ashes, thy eyes&apos; windows fall,
Like death, when he shuts up the day of life;
Each part, deprived of supple government,
Shall, stiff and stark and cold, appear like death:
And in this borrow&apos;d likeness of shrunk death
Thou shalt continue two and forty hours,
And then awake as from a pleasant sleep.
Now, when the bridegroom in the morning comes
To rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead:
Then, as the manner of our country is,
In thy best robes uncover&apos;d on the bier
Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault
Where all the kindred of the Capulets lie.
In the mean time, against thou shalt awake,
Shall Romeo by my letters know our drift,
And hither shall he come: and he and I
Will watch thy waking, and that very night
Shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua.
And this shall free thee from this present shame;
If no inconstant toy, nor womanish fear,
Abate thy valour in the acting it.

[Give me, give me! O, tell not me of fear!]

Hold; get you gone, be strong and prosperous
In this resolve: I&apos;ll send a friar with speed
To Mantua, with my letters to thy lord.</string>

I have a faint cold fear thrills through my veins,
That almost freezes up the heat of life:
I&apos;ll call them back again to comfort me:
Nurse! What should she do here?
My dismal scene I needs must act alone.
Come, vial.
What if this mixture do not work at all?
Shall I be married then to-morrow morning?
No, no: this shall forbid it: lie thou there.

[laying down her dagger]

What if it be a poison, which the friar
Subtly hath minister&apos;d to have me dead,
Lest in this marriage he should be dishonour&apos;d,
Because he married me before to Romeo?
I fear it is: and yet, methinks, it should not,
For he hath still been tried a holy man.
How if, when I am laid into the tomb,
I wake before the time that Romeo
Come to redeem me? there&apos;s a fearful point!
Shall I not, then, be stifled in the vault,
To whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in,
And there die strangled ere my Romeo comes?
Or, if I live, is it not very like,
The horrible conceit of death and night,
Together with the terror of the place,--
As in a vault, an ancient receptacle,
Where, for these many hundred years, the bones
Of all my buried ancestors are packed:
Where bloody Tybalt, yet but green in earth,
Lies festering in his shroud; where, as they say,
At some hours in the night spirits resort;--
Alack, alack, is it not like that I,
So early waking, what with loathsome smells,
And shrieks like mandrakes&apos; torn out of the earth,
That living mortals, hearing them, run mad:--
O, if I wake, shall I not be distraught,
Environed with all these hideous fears?
And madly play with my forefather&apos;s joints?
And pluck the mangled Tybalt from his shroud?
And, in this rage, with some great kinsman&apos;s bone,
As with a club, dash out my desperate brains?
O, look! methinks I see my cousin&apos;s ghost
Seeking out Romeo, that did spit his body
Upon a rapier&apos;s point: stay, Tybalt, stay!
Romeo, I come! this do I drink to thee.</string>

After Romeo learns that Juliet is dead, he makes a decision to go to Juliet&apos;s tomb to be with her when he kills himself. He remembers passing by a pharmacist who decorated their shop strangely, and is certain he could find a fatal poison there. When the shop is closed, he calls for the owner and pays him for a fast-acting poison. When the pharmacist balks at seling illegal goods, Romeo insists that his money is worth risking the law&apos;s punishment.</string>

		<string>Well, Juliet, I will lie with thee to-night.
Let&apos;s see for means: O mischief, thou art swift
To enter in the thoughts of desperate men!
I do remember an apothecary,--
And hereabouts he dwells,--which late I noted
In tatter&apos;d weeds, with overwhelming brows,
Culling of simples; meagre were his looks,
Sharp misery had worn him to the bones:
And in his needy shop a tortoise hung,
An alligator stuff&apos;d, and other skins
Of ill-shaped fishes; and about his shelves
A beggarly account of empty boxes,
Green earthen pots, bladders and musty seeds,
Remnants of packthread and old cakes of roses,
Were thinly scatter&apos;d, to make up a show.
Noting this penury, to myself I said
&apos;An if a man did need a poison now,
Whose sale is present death in Mantua,
Here lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him.&apos;
O, this same thought did but forerun my need;
And this same needy man must sell it me.
As I remember, this should be the house.
Being holiday, the beggar&apos;s shop is shut.
What, ho! apothecary!

[Who calls so loud?]

Come hither, man. I see that thou art poor:
Hold, there is forty ducats: let me have
A dram of poison, such soon-speeding gear
As will disperse itself through all the veins
That the life-weary taker may fall dead
And that the trunk may be discharged of breath
As violently as hasty powder fired
Doth hurry from the fatal cannon&apos;s womb.

[Such mortal drugs I have; but Mantua&apos;s law
Is death to any he that utters them.]

Art thou so bare and full of wretchedness,
And fear&apos;st to die? famine is in thy cheeks,
Need and oppression starveth in thine eyes,
Contempt and beggary hangs upon thy back;
The world is not thy friend nor the world&apos;s law;
The world affords no law to make thee rich;
Then be not poor, but break it, and take this.</string>

Before he goes to take poison and die with Juliet in her tomb, Romeo tells his servant, Balthasar, to deliever a letter to Romeo&apos;s father, and assure him that he&apos;s going to Juliet&apos;s tomb only to take a ring that he gave her and then return. He warns Balthasar against coming into the tomb, or else Romeo would kill him.</string>

		<string>Give me that mattock and the wrenching iron.
Hold, take this letter; early in the morning
See thou deliver it to my lord and father.
Give me the light: upon thy life, I charge thee,
Whate&apos;er thou hear&apos;st or seest, stand all aloof,
And do not interrupt me in my course.
Why I descend into this bed of death,
Is partly to behold my lady&apos;s face;
But chiefly to take thence from her dead finger
A precious ring, a ring that I must use
In dear employment: therefore hence, be gone:
But if thou, jealous, dost return to pry
In what I further shall intend to do,
By heaven, I will tear thee joint by joint
And strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs:
The time and my intents are savage-wild,
More fierce and more inexorable far
Than empty tigers or the roaring sea.</string>

Mercutio&apos;s kinsman, noble County Paris!
What said my man, when my betossed soul
Did not attend him as we rode? I think
He told me Paris should have married Juliet:
Said he not so? or did I dream it so?
Or am I mad, hearing him talk of Juliet,
To think it was so? O, give me thy hand,
One writ with me in sour misfortune&apos;s book!
I&apos;ll bury thee in a triumphant grave;
A grave? O no! a lantern, slaughter&apos;d youth,
For here lies Juliet, and her beauty makes
This vault a feasting presence full of light.
Death, lie thou there, by a dead man interr&apos;d.</string>

Romeo realizes he is almost excited to die by Juliet. He is glad to see that she is still beautiful in death. He sees Tybalt&apos;s tomb, too. He imagines that Death itself loves Juliet, and so gets ready to take his poison; he looks at her, embraces her, kisses her, takes the poison, and then dies.</string>

Have they been merry! which their keepers call
A lightning before death: O, how may I
Call this a lightning? O my love! my wife!
Death, that hath suck&apos;d the honey of thy breath,
Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty:
Thou art not conquer&apos;d; beauty&apos;s ensign yet
Is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks,
And death&apos;s pale flag is not advanced there.
Tybalt, liest thou there in thy bloody sheet?
O, what more favour can I do to thee,
Than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain
To sunder his that was thine enemy?
Forgive me, cousin! Ah, dear Juliet,
Why art thou yet so fair? shall I believe
That unsubstantial death is amorous,
And that the lean abhorred monster keeps
Thee here in dark to be his paramour?
For fear of that, I still will stay with thee;
And never from this palace of dim night
Depart again: here, here will I remain
With worms that are thy chamber-maids; O, here
Will I set up my everlasting rest,
And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars
From this world-wearied flesh. Eyes, look your last!
Arms, take your last embrace! and, lips, O you
The doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss
A dateless bargain to engrossing death!
Come, bitter conduct, come, unsavoury guide!
Thou desperate pilot, now at once run on
The dashing rocks thy sea-sick weary bark!
Here&apos;s to my love!

Friar Lawrence recounts the events of the last three acts to the Capulets, the Montagues, and the Prince; he married Romeo and Juliet the day Tybalt died; he give Juliet a sleeping potion to let her avoid marrying Paris; he sent a message to Romeo, but it was delayed, so Romeo thought Juliet was dead; he came to the tomb to find that Romeo and Paris were both dead, and Juliet awakening. When he went to check the entrance, Juliet killed herself.</string>

		<string>I will be brief, for my short date of breath
Is not so long as is a tedious tale.
Romeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet;
And she, there dead, that Romeo&apos;s faithful wife:
I married them; and their stol&apos;n marriage-day
Was Tybalt&apos;s dooms-day, whose untimely death
Banish&apos;d the new-made bridegroom from the city,
For whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pined.
You, to remove that siege of grief from her,
Betroth&apos;d and would have married her perforce
To County Paris: then comes she to me,
And, with wild looks, bid me devise some mean
To rid her from this second marriage,
Or in my cell there would she kill herself.
Then gave I her, so tutor&apos;d by my art,
A sleeping potion; which so took effect
As I intended, for it wrought on her
The form of death: meantime I writ to Romeo,
That he should hither come as this dire night,
To help to take her from her borrow&apos;d grave,
Being the time the potion&apos;s force should cease.
But he which bore my letter, Friar John,
Was stay&apos;d by accident, and yesternight
Return&apos;d my letter back. Then all alone
At the prefixed hour of her waking,
Came I to take her from her kindred&apos;s vault;
Meaning to keep her closely at my cell,
Till I conveniently could send to Romeo:
But when I came, some minute ere the time
Of her awaking, here untimely lay
The noble Paris and true Romeo dead.
She wakes; and I entreated her come forth,
And bear this work of heaven with patience:
But then a noise did scare me from the tomb;
And she, too desperate, would not go with me,
But, as it seems, did violence on herself.
All this I know; and to the marriage
Her nurse is privy: and, if aught in this
Miscarried by my fault, let my old life
Be sacrificed, some hour before his time,
Unto the rigour of severest law.

Than this is all as true as it is strange: 
Nay, it is ten times true; for truth is truth
To the end of reckoning.

That I am touch&apos;d with madness! Make not impossible
That which but seems unlike: &apos;tis not impossible

A poet, working for Timon, notices several Athenian senators entering Timon&apos;s house to pay their respects, and is certain he can predict what will happen to Timon. When pressed by a painter (also working for Timon), the poet notes how Timon&apos;s wealth and generosity draws many admirers, from flatterers to harsh critics. He describes his latest poem about Timon; a man enthroned by Fortune and adored by many who will be abandoned by those same people when his luck runs out.</string>

		<string>The senators of Athens: happy man!

[Look, more!]

You see this confluence, this great flood
of visitors.
I have, in this rough work, shaped out a man,
Whom this beneath world doth embrace and hug
With amplest entertainment: my free drift
Halts not particularly, but moves itself
In a wide sea of wax: no levell&apos;d malice
Infects one comma in the course I hold;
But flies an eagle flight, bold and forth on,
Leaving no tract behind.

[How shall I understand you?]

I will unbolt to you.
You see how all conditions, how all minds,
As well of glib and slippery creatures as
Of grave and austere quality, tender down
Their services to Lord Timon: his large fortune
Upon his good and gracious nature hanging
Subdues and properties to his love and tendance
All sorts of hearts; yea, from the glass-faced flatterer
To Apemantus, that few things loves better
Than to abhor himself: even he drops down
The knee before him, and returns in peace
Most rich in Timon&apos;s nod.

[I saw them speak together.]

Sir, I have upon a high and pleasant hill
Feign&apos;d Fortune to be throned: the base o&apos; the mount
Is rank&apos;d with all deserts, all kind of natures,
That labour on the bosom of this sphere
To propagate their states: amongst them all,
Whose eyes are on this sovereign lady fix&apos;d,
One do I personate of Lord Timon&apos;s frame,
Whom Fortune with her ivory hand wafts to her;
Whose present grace to present slaves and servants
Translates his rivals.

[&apos;Tis conceived to scope.
This throne, this Fortune, and this hill, methinks,
With one man beckon&apos;d from the rest below,
Bowing his head against the sleepy mount
To climb his happiness, would be well express&apos;d
In our condition.]

Nay, sir, but hear me on.
All those which were his fellows but of late,
Some better than his value, on the moment
Follow his strides, his lobbies fill with tendance,
Rain sacrificial whisperings in his ear,
Make sacred even his stirrup, and through him
Drink the free air.

[Ay, marry, what of these?]

When Fortune in her shift and change of mood
Spurns down her late beloved, all his dependants
Which labour&apos;d after him to the mountain&apos;s top
Even on their knees and hands, let him slip down,
Not one accompanying his declining foot.</string>

I wonder men dare trust themselves with men:
Methinks they should invite them without knives;
Good for their meat, and safer for their lives.
There&apos;s much example for&apos;t; the fellow that sits next him now, parts bread with him, pledges the breath of him in a divided draught, is the readiest man to kill him: &apos;t has been proved. If I were a huge man, I should fear to drink at meals;
Lest they should spy my windpipe&apos;s dangerous notes:
Great men should drink with harness on their throats.

[My lord, in heart; and let the health go round.]

[Flow this way! A brave fellow! he keeps his tides well. Those healths will make thee and thy state look ill, Timon. Here&apos;s that which is too weak to be a sinner, honest water, which ne&apos;er left man i&apos; the mire:
This and my food are equals; there&apos;s no odds:
Feasts are too proud to give thanks to the gods.
Apemantus&apos; grace.
Immortal gods, I crave no pelf;
I pray for no man but myself:
Grant I may never prove so fond,
To trust man on his oath or bond;
Or a harlot, for her weeping;
Or a dog, that seems a-sleeping:
Or a keeper with my freedom;
Or my friends, if I should need &apos;em.
Amen. So fall to&apos;t:
Rich men sin, and I eat root.]

And give it Timon, why, the dog coins gold.

Ask nothing, give it him, it foals me, straight,

All that pass by. It cannot hold: no reason

Get on your cloak, and haste you to Lord Timon;
Importune him for my moneys; be not ceased
With slight denial, nor then silenced when--
&apos;Commend me to your master&apos;--and the cap
Plays in the right hand, thus: but tell him,
My uses cry to me, I must serve my turn
Out of mine own; his days and times are past
And my reliances on his fracted dates
Have smit my credit: I love and honour him,
But must not break my back to heal his finger;
Immediate are my needs, and my relief
Must not be toss&apos;d and turn&apos;d to me in words,
But find supply immediate. Get you gone:
Put on a most importunate aspect,
A visage of demand; for, I do fear,
When every feather sticks in his own wing,
Lord Timon will be left a naked gull,
Which flashes now a phoenix. Get you gone.</string>

[Go to:
Perchance some single vantages you took.
When my indisposition put you back:
And that unaptness made your minister,
Thus to excuse yourself.]

O my good lord,
At many times I brought in my accounts,
Laid them before you; you would throw them off,
And say, you found them in mine honesty.
When, for some trifling present, you have bid me
Return so much, I have shook my head and wept;
Yea, &apos;gainst the authority of manners, pray&apos;d you
To hold your hand more close: I did endure
Not seldom, nor no slight cheques, when I have
Prompted you in the ebb of your estate
And your great flow of debts. My loved lord,
Though you hear now, too late--yet now&apos;s a time--
The greatest of your having lacks a half
To pay your present debts.

[Let all my land be sold.]

&apos;Tis all engaged, some forfeited and gone;
And what remains will hardly stop the mouth
Of present dues: the future comes apace:
What shall defend the interim? and at length
How goes our reckoning?

[To Lacedaemon did my land extend.]

O my good lord, the world is but a word:
Were it all yours to give it in a breath,
How quickly were it gone!

If you suspect my husbandry or falsehood,
Call me before the exactest auditors
And set me on the proof. So the gods bless me,
When all our offices have been oppress&apos;d
With riotous feeders, when our vaults have wept
With drunken spilth of wine, when every room
Hath blazed with lights and bray&apos;d with minstrelsy,
I have retired me to a wasteful cock,
And set mine eyes at flow.

[Prithee, no more.]

Heavens, have I said, the bounty of this lord!
How many prodigal bits have slaves and peasants
This night englutted! Who is not Timon&apos;s?
What heart, head, sword, force, means, but is
Lord Timon&apos;s?
Great Timon, noble, worthy, royal Timon!
Ah, when the means are gone that buy this praise,
The breath is gone whereof this praise is made:
Feast-won, fast-lost; one cloud of winter showers,
These flies are couch&apos;d.</string>

No villanous bounty yet hath pass&apos;d my heart;
Unwisely, not ignobly, have I given.
Why dost thou weep? Canst thou the conscience lack,
To think I shall lack friends? Secure thy heart;
If I would broach the vessels of my love,
And try the argument of hearts by borrowing,
Men and men&apos;s fortunes could I frankly use
As I can bid thee speak.

That I account them blessings; for by these
Shall I try friends: you shall perceive how you
Mistake my fortunes; I am wealthy in my friends.

		<string>Why, this is the world&apos;s soul; and just of the
same piece
Is every flatterer&apos;s spirit. Who can call him
His friend that dips in the same dish? for, in
My knowing, Timon has been this lord&apos;s father,
And kept his credit with his purse,
Supported his estate; nay, Timon&apos;s money
Has paid his men their wages: he ne&apos;er drinks,
But Timon&apos;s silver treads upon his lip;
And yet--O, see the monstrousness of man
When he looks out in an ungrateful shape!--
He does deny him, in respect of his,
What charitable men afford to beggars.

[Religion groans at it.]

For mine own part,
I never tasted Timon in my life,
Nor came any of his bounties over me,
To mark me for his friend; yet, I protest,
For his right noble mind, illustrious virtue
And honourable carriage,
Had his necessity made use of me,
I would have put my wealth into donation,
And the best half should have return&apos;d to him,
So much I love his heart: but, I perceive,
Men must learn now with pity to dispense;
For policy sits above conscience.</string>

It shows but little love or judgment in him:
Must I be his last refuge! His friends, like

Thrive, give him over: must I take the cure upon me?
Has much disgraced me in&apos;t; I&apos;m angry at him,

For, in my conscience, I was the first man

So it may prove an argument of laughter
To the rest, and &apos;mongst lords I be thought a fool.

[Now, captain?]

I am an humble suitor to your virtues;
For pity is the virtue of the law,
And none but tyrants use it cruelly.
It pleases time and fortune to lie heavy
Upon a friend of mine, who, in hot blood,
Hath stepp&apos;d into the law, which is past depth
To those that, without heed, do plunge into &apos;t.
He is a man, setting his fate aside,
Of comely virtues:
Nor did he soil the fact with cowardice--
An honour in him which buys out his fault--
But with a noble fury and fair spirit,
Seeing his reputation touch&apos;d to death,
He did oppose his foe:
And with such sober and unnoted passion
He did behave his anger, ere &apos;twas spent,
As if he had but proved an argument.</string>

After Timon leaves Athens, Flavius splits his pay among all the servants and bids them farewell. When they go, he reveals that he is not afraid of wealth, seeing that it made Timon&apos;s friends betray him. He laments that even being a good person doesn&apos;t not seem wise, seeing what happend to Timon. He goes to find Timon and join him in the woods.</string>

		<string>What will this come to?
He commands us to provide, and give great gifts,
And all out of an empty coffer:
Nor will he know his purse, or yield me this,
To show him what a beggar his heart is,
Being of no power to make his wishes good:
His promises fly so beyond his state
That what he speaks is all in debt; he owes
For every word: he is so kind that he now
Pays interest for &apos;t; his land&apos;s put to their books.
Well, would I were gently put out of office
Before I were forced out!
Happier is he that has no friend to feed
Than such that do e&apos;en enemies exceed.
I bleed inwardly for my lord.</string>

Now living in the woods, Timon wishes that, along with light, the sun should shine down to make everyone sick of each other, since everyone is horrible, anyway. Digging in the earth, he finds a lot of gold, then tries to hide it, speaking of how it makes people try to become the opposite of what they are, going against their nature.</string>

		<string>O blessed breeding sun, draw from the earth
Rotten humidity; below thy sister&apos;s orb
Infect the air! Twinn&apos;d brothers of one womb,
Whose procreation, residence, and birth,
Scarce is dividant, touch them with several fortunes;
The greater scorns the lesser: not nature,
To whom all sores lay siege, can bear great fortune,
But by contempt of nature.
Raise me this beggar, and deny &apos;t that lord;
The senator shall bear contempt hereditary,
The beggar native honour.
It is the pasture lards the rother&apos;s sides,
The want that makes him lean. Who dares, who dares,
In purity of manhood stand upright,
And say &apos;This man&apos;s a flatterer?&apos; if one be,
So are they all; for every grise of fortune
Is smooth&apos;d by that below: the learned pate
Ducks to the golden fool: all is oblique;
There&apos;s nothing level in our cursed natures,
But direct villany. Therefore, be abhorr&apos;d
All feasts, societies, and throngs of men!
His semblable, yea, himself, Timon disdains:
Destruction fang mankind! Earth, yield me roots!

[digging]

Who seeks for better of thee, sauce his palate
With thy most operant poison! What is here?
Gold? yellow, glittering, precious gold? No, gods,
I am no idle votarist: roots, you clear heavens!
Thus much of this will make black white, foul fair,
Wrong right, base noble, old young, coward valiant.
Ha, you gods! why this? what this, you gods? Why, this
Will lug your priests and servants from your sides,
Pluck stout men&apos;s pillows from below their heads:
This yellow slave
Will knit and break religions, bless the accursed,
Make the hoar leprosy adored, place thieves
And give them title, knee and approbation
With senators on the bench: this is it
That makes the wappen&apos;d widow wed again;
She, whom the spital-house and ulcerous sores
Would cast the gorge at, this embalms and spices
To the April day again. Come, damned earth,
Thou common whore of mankind, that put&apos;st odds
Among the route of nations, I will make thee
Do thy right nature.</string>

		<string>What, have I scaped love-letters in the holiday-
time of my beauty, and am I now a subject for them?
Let me see.
[Reads]
&apos;Ask me no reason why I love you; for though
Love use Reason for his physician, he admits him
not for his counsellor. You are not young, no more
am I; go to then, there&apos;s sympathy: you are merry, 
so am I; ha, ha! then there&apos;s more sympathy: you
love sack, and so do I; would you desire better
sympathy? Let it suffice thee, Mistress Page,—at
the least, if the love of soldier can suffice,—
that I love thee. I will not say, pity me; &apos;tis 
not a soldier-like phrase: but I say, love me. By me,
Thine own true knight,
By day or night,
Or any kind of light,
With all his might 
For thee to fight, JOHN FALSTAFF&apos;
What a Herod of Jewry is this! O wicked
world! One that is well-nigh worn to pieces with
age to show himself a young gallant! What an
unweighed behavior hath this Flemish drunkard
picked—with the devil&apos;s name!—out of my
conversation, that he dares in this manner assay me?
Why, he hath not been thrice in my company! What
should I say to him? I was then frugal of my
mirth: Heaven forgive me! Why, I&apos;ll exhibit a bill
in the parliament for the putting down of men. How
shall I be revenged on him? for revenged I will be,
as sure as his guts are made of puddings.</string>

[Ay, Timon, and have cause.]

The gods confound them all in thy conquest;
And thee after, when thou hast conquer&apos;d!

[Why me, Timon?]

That, by killing of villains,
Thou wast born to conquer my country.
Put up thy gold: go on,--here&apos;s gold,--go on;
Be as a planetary plague, when Jove
Will o&apos;er some high-viced city hang his poison
In the sick air: let not thy sword skip one:
Pity not honour&apos;d age for his white beard;
He is an usurer: strike me the counterfeit matron;
It is her habit only that is honest,
Herself&apos;s a bawd: let not the virgin&apos;s cheek
Make soft thy trenchant sword; for those milk-paps,
That through the window-bars bore at men&apos;s eyes,
Are not within the leaf of pity writ,
But set them down horrible traitors: spare not the babe,
Whose dimpled smiles from fools exhaust their mercy;
Think it a bastard, whom the oracle
Hath doubtfully pronounced thy throat shall cut,
And mince it sans remorse: swear against objects;
Put armour on thine ears and on thine eyes;
Whose proof, nor yells of mothers, maids, nor babes,
Nor sight of priests in holy vestments bleeding,
Shall pierce a jot. There&apos;s gold to pay soldiers:
Make large confusion; and, thy fury spent,
Confounded be thyself! Speak not, be gone.</string>

In hollow bones of man; strike their sharp shins,
And mar men&apos;s spurring. Crack the lawyer&apos;s voice,

Nor sound his quillets shrilly: hoar the flamen,
That scolds against the quality of flesh,
And not believes himself: down with the nose,
Down with it flat; take the bridge quite away
Of him that, his particular to foresee,
Smells from the general weal: make curl&apos;d-pate
ruffians bald;
And let the unscarr&apos;d braggarts of the war
Derive some pain from you: plague all;
That your activity may defeat and quell
The source of all erection. There&apos;s more gold:

Thou dost affect my manners, and dost use them.

[&apos;Tis, then, because thou dost not keep a dog,
Whom I would imitate: consumption catch thee!]

This is in thee a nature but infected;
A poor unmanly melancholy sprung
From change of fortune. Why this spade? this place?
This slave-like habit? and these looks of care?
Thy flatterers yet wear silk, drink wine, lie soft;
Hug their diseased perfumes, and have forgot
That ever Timon was. Shame not these woods,
By putting on the cunning of a carper.
Be thou a flatterer now, and seek to thrive
By that which has undone thee: hinge thy knee,
And let his very breath, whom thou&apos;lt observe,
Blow off thy cap; praise his most vicious strain,
And call it excellent: thou wast told thus;
Thou gavest thine ears like tapsters that bid welcome
To knaves and all approachers: &apos;tis most just
That thou turn rascal; hadst thou wealth again,
Rascals should have &apos;t. Do not assume my likeness.

[Were I like thee, I&apos;ld throw away myself.]

Thou hast cast away thyself, being like thyself;
A madman so long, now a fool. What, think&apos;st
That the bleak air, thy boisterous chamberlain,
Will put thy shirt on warm? will these moss&apos;d trees,
That have outlived the eagle, page thy heels,
And skip where thou point&apos;st out? will the
cold brook,
Candied with ice, caudle thy morning taste,
To cure thy o&apos;er-night&apos;s surfeit? Call the creatures
Whose naked natures live in an the spite
Of wreakful heaven, whose bare unhoused trunks,
To the conflicting elements exposed,
Answer mere nature; bid them flatter thee;
O, thou shalt find--

[A fool of thee: depart.]

Fell from their boughs and left me open, bare

		<string>Your greatest want is, you want much of meat.
Why should you want? Behold, the earth hath roots;
Within this mile break forth a hundred springs;
The oaks bear mast, the briers scarlet hips;
The bounteous housewife, nature, on each bush
Lays her full mess before you. Want! why want?

[We cannot live on grass, on berries, water,
As beasts and birds and fishes.]

Nor on the beasts themselves, the birds, and fishes;
You must eat men. Yet thanks I must you con
That you are thieves profess&apos;d, that you work not
In holier shapes: for there is boundless theft
In limited professions. Rascal thieves,
Here&apos;s gold. Go, suck the subtle blood o&apos; the grape,
Till the high fever seethe your blood to froth,
And so &apos;scape hanging: trust not the physician;
His antidotes are poison, and he slays
Moe than you rob: take wealth and lives together;
Do villany, do, since you protest to do&apos;t,
Like workmen. I&apos;ll example you with thievery.
The sun&apos;s a thief, and with his great attraction
Robs the vast sea: the moon&apos;s an arrant thief,
And her pale fire she snatches from the sun:
The sea&apos;s a thief, whose liquid surge resolves
The moon into salt tears: the earth&apos;s a thief,
That feeds and breeds by a composture stolen
From general excrement: each thing&apos;s a thief:
The laws, your curb and whip, in their rough power
Have uncheque&apos;d theft. Love not yourselves: away,
Rob one another. There&apos;s more gold. Cut throats:
All that you meet are thieves: to Athens go,
Break open shops; nothing can you steal,
But thieves do lose it: steal no less for this
I give you; and gold confound you howsoe&apos;er! Amen.</string>

Is yond despised and ruinous man my lord?
Full of decay and failing? O monument
And wonder of good deeds evilly bestow&apos;d!
What an alteration of honour
Has desperate want made!
What viler thing upon the earth than friends
Who can bring noblest minds to basest ends!
How rarely does it meet with this time&apos;s guise,
When man was wish&apos;d to love his enemies!
Grant I may ever love, and rather woo
Those that would mischief me than those that do!
Has caught me in his eye: I will present
My honest grief unto him; and, as my lord,
Still serve him with my life. My dearest master!</string>

When Flavius proves that he is being honest, Timon decides to give him much gold, telling Flavius to spend it only on himself and denying it to others.</string>

Here, take: the gods out of my misery
Have sent thee treasure. Go, live rich and happy;
But thus condition&apos;d: thou shalt build from men;
Hate all, curse all, show charity to none,
But let the famish&apos;d flesh slide from the bone,
Ere thou relieve the beggar; give to dogs

For many good and great deserts to Rome:
A nobler man, a braver warrior,
Lives not this day within the city walls:
He by the senate is accit&apos;d home
From weary wars against the barbarous Goths;
That, with his sons, a terror to our foes,
Hath yoked a nation strong, train&apos;d up in arms.
Ten years are spent since first he undertook
This cause of Rome and chastised with arms
Our enemies&apos; pride: five times he hath return&apos;d
Bleeding to Rome, bearing his valiant sons
In coffins from the field;
And now at last, laden with horror&apos;s spoils,
Returns the good Andronicus to Rome,
Renowned Titus, flourishing in arms.
Let us entreat, by honour of his name,
Whom worthily you would have now succeed.
And in the Capitol and senate&apos;s right,
Whom you pretend to honour and adore,
That you withdraw you and abate your strength;
Dismiss your followers and, as suitors should,
Plead your deserts in peace and humbleness.</string>

Half of the number that King Priam had,
Behold the poor remains, alive and dead!
These that survive let Rome reward with love;
These that I bring unto their latest home,
With burial amongst their ancestors:
Here Goths have given me leave to sheathe my sword.
Titus, unkind and careless of thine own,
Why suffer&apos;st thou thy sons, unburied yet,
To hover on the dreadful shore of Styx?
Make way to lay them by their brethren.

And sleep in peace, slain in your country&apos;s wars!

Which Rome reputes to be a heinous sin,
Yield at entreats; and then let me alone:
I&apos;ll find a day to massacre them all
And raze their faction and their family,
The cruel father and his traitorous sons,
To whom I sued for my dear son&apos;s life,
And make them know what &apos;tis to let a queen
Kneel in the streets and beg for grace in vain.</string>

A Roman now adopted happily,
And must advise the emperor for his good.
This day all quarrels die, Andronicus;
And let it be mine honour, good my lord,
That I have reconciled your friends and you.
For you, Prince Bassianus, I have pass&apos;d
My word and promise to the emperor,
That you will be more mild and tractable.
And fear not lords, and you, Lavinia;
By my advice, all humbled on your knees,
You shall ask pardon of his majesty.</string>

When every thing doth make a gleeful boast?
The birds chant melody on every bush,
The snake lies rolled in the cheerful sun,
The green leaves quiver with the cooling wind
And make a chequer&apos;d shadow on the ground:
Under their sweet shade, Aaron, let us sit,
And, whilst the babbling echo mocks the hounds,
Replying shrilly to the well-tuned horns,
As if a double hunt were heard at once,
Let us sit down and mark their yelping noise;
And, after conflict such as was supposed
The wandering prince and Dido once enjoy&apos;d,
When with a happy storm they were surprised
And curtain&apos;d with a counsel-keeping cave,
We may, each wreathed in the other&apos;s arms,
Our pastimes done, possess a golden slumber;
Whiles hounds and horns and sweet melodious birds
Be unto us as is a nurse&apos;s song
Of lullaby to bring her babe asleep.</string>

My silence and my cloudy melancholy,
My fleece of woolly hair that now uncurls
Even as an adder when she doth unroll
To do some fatal execution?
No, madam, these are no venereal signs:
Vengeance is in my heart, death in my hand,
Blood and revenge are hammering in my head.
Hark Tamora, the empress of my soul,
Which never hopes more heaven than rests in thee,
This is the day of doom for Bassianus:
His Philomel must lose her tongue to-day,
Thy sons make pillage of her chastity
And wash their hands in Bassianus&apos; blood.
Seest thou this letter? take it up, I pray thee,
And give the king this fatal plotted scroll.
Now question me no more; we are espied;
Here comes a parcel of our hopeful booty,
Which dreads not yet their lives&apos; destruction.</string>

These two have &apos;ticed me hither to this place:
A barren detested vale, you see it is;
The trees, though summer, yet forlorn and lean,
O&apos;ercome with moss and baleful mistletoe:
Here never shines the sun; here nothing breeds,
Unless the nightly owl or fatal raven:
And when they show&apos;d me this abhorred pit,
They told me, here, at dead time of the night,
A thousand fiends, a thousand hissing snakes,
Ten thousand swelling toads, as many urchins,
Would make such fearful and confused cries
As any mortal body hearing it
Should straight fall mad, or else die suddenly.
No sooner had they told this hellish tale,
But straight they told me they would bind me here
Unto the body of a dismal yew,
And leave me to this miserable death:
And then they call&apos;d me foul adulteress,
Lascivious Goth, and all the bitterest terms
That ever ear did hear to such effect:
And, had you not by wondrous fortune come,
This vengeance on me had they executed.
Revenge it, as you love your mother&apos;s life,
Or be ye not henceforth call&apos;d my children.</string>

And shows the ragged entrails of the pit:
So pale did shine the moon on Pyramus
When he by night lay bathed in maiden blood.

If fear hath made thee faint, as me it hath--
Out of this fell devouring receptacle,
As hateful as Cocytus&apos; misty mouth.</string>

		<string>Who is this? my niece, that flies away so fast!
Cousin, a word; where is your husband?
If I do dream, would all my wealth would wake me!
If I do wake, some planet strike me down,
That I may slumber in eternal sleep!
Speak, gentle niece, what stern ungentle hands
Have lopp&apos;d and hew&apos;d and made thy body bare
Of her two branches, those sweet ornaments,
Whose circling shadows kings have sought to sleep in,
And might not gain so great a happiness
As have thy love? Why dost not speak to me?
Alas, a crimson river of warm blood,
Like to a bubbling fountain stirr&apos;d with wind,
Doth rise and fall between thy rosed lips,
Coming and going with thy honey breath.
But, sure, some Tereus hath deflowered thee,
And, lest thou shouldst detect him, cut thy tongue.
Ah, now thou turn&apos;st away thy face for shame!
And, notwithstanding all this loss of blood,
As from a conduit with three issuing spouts,
Yet do thy cheeks look red as Titan&apos;s face
Blushing to be encountered with a cloud.
Shall I speak for thee? shall I say &apos;tis so?
O, that I knew thy heart; and knew the beast,
That I might rail at him, to ease my mind!
Sorrow concealed, like an oven stopp&apos;d,
Doth burn the heart to cinders where it is.
Fair Philomela, she but lost her tongue,
And in a tedious sampler sew&apos;d her mind:
But, lovely niece, that mean is cut from thee;
A craftier Tereus, cousin, hast thou met,
And he hath cut those pretty fingers off,
That could have better sew&apos;d than Philomel.
O, had the monster seen those lily hands
Tremble, like aspen-leaves, upon a lute,
And make the silken strings delight to kiss them,
He would not then have touch&apos;d them for his life!
Or, had he heard the heavenly harmony
Which that sweet tongue hath made,
He would have dropp&apos;d his knife, and fell asleep
As Cerberus at the Thracian poet&apos;s feet.
Come, let us go, and make thy father blind;
For such a sight will blind a father&apos;s eye:
One hour&apos;s storm will drown the fragrant meads;
What will whole months of tears thy father&apos;s eyes?
Do not draw back, for we will mourn with thee
O, could our mourning ease thy misery!</string>

In dangerous wars, whilst you securely slept;
For all my blood in Rome&apos;s great quarrel shed;
For all the frosty nights that I have watch&apos;d;
And for these bitter tears, which now you see
Filling the aged wrinkles in my cheeks;

Whose souls are not corrupted as &apos;tis thought.
For two and twenty sons I never wept,
Because they died in honour&apos;s lofty bed.

For these, these, tribunes, in the dust I write
My heart&apos;s deep languor and my soul&apos;s sad tears:
Let my tears stanch the earth&apos;s dry appetite;
My sons&apos; sweet blood will make it shame and blush.
O earth, I will befriend thee more with rain,
That shall distil from these two ancient urns,
Than youthful April shall with all his showers:
In summer&apos;s drought I&apos;ll drop upon thee still;
In winter with warm tears I&apos;ll melt the snow
And keep eternal spring-time on thy face,
So thou refuse to drink my dear sons&apos; blood.
O reverend tribunes! O gentle, aged men!
Unbind my sons, reverse the doom of death;
And let me say, that never wept before,
My tears are now prevailing orators.</string>

		<string>How happy some o&apos;er other some can be!
Through Athens I am thought as fair as she.
But what of that? Demetrius thinks not so.
He will not know what all but he do know.
And as he errs, doting on Hermia’s eyes,
So I, admiring of his qualities.
Things base and vile, holding no quantity,
Love can transpose to form and dignity.
Love looks not with the eyes but with the mind.
And therefore is winged Cupid painted blind.
Nor hath Love’s mind of any judgment taste—
Wings and no eyes figure unheedy haste.
And therefore is Love said to be a child,
Because in choice he is so oft beguiled.
As waggish boys in game themselves forswear,
So the boy Love is perjured everywhere.
For ere Demetrius looked on Hermia’s eyne,
He hailed down oaths that he was only mine.
And when this hail some heat from Hermia felt,
So he dissolved, and showers of oaths did melt.
I will go tell him of fair Hermia’s flight.
Then to the wood will he tomorrow night
Pursue her. And for this intelligence
If I have thanks, it is a dear expense.
But herein mean I to enrich my pain,
To have his sight thither and back again.</string>

after gift; smelling so sweetly, all musk, and so
rushling, I warrant you, in silk and gold; and in
such alligant terms; and in such wine and sugar of
the best and the fairest, that would have won any
woman&apos;s heart; and, I warrant you, they could never
get an eye-wink of her: I had myself twenty angels
given me this morning; but I defy all angels, in
any such sort, as they say, but in the way of
honesty: and, I warrant you, they could never get
her so much as sip on a cup with the proudest of
them all: and yet there has been earls, nay, which
is more, pensioners; but, I warrant you, all is one with her.

Marry, she hath received your letter, for the which
she thanks you a thousand times; and she gives you
to notify that her husband will be absence from his
house between ten and eleven.</string>

		<string>Why, tis no matter, man; if they did hear,
They would not mark me, or if they did mark,
They would not pity me, yet plead I must;
Therefore I tell my sorrows to the stones;
Who, though they cannot answer my distress,
Yet in some sort they are better than the tribunes,
For that they will not intercept my tale:
When I do weep, they humbly at my feet
Receive my tears and seem to weep with me;
And, were they but attired in grave weeds,
Rome could afford no tribune like to these.
A stone is soft as wax,--tribunes more hard than stones;
A stone is silent, and offendeth not,
And tribunes with their tongues doom men to death.

When Lavinia is brought toward him without her tongue or hands, he tells Lucius to react more bravely, and says he was already lamenting the deaths of his sons, and so more tragic events won&apos;t change much. He says that hands are useless, anyway, since deeds done in Rome&apos;s name can&apos;t seem to earn any mercy.</string>

		<string>Faint-hearted boy, arise, and look upon her.
Speak, Lavinia, what accursed hand
Hath made thee handless in thy father&apos;s sight?
What fool hath added water to the sea,
Or brought a faggot to bright-burning Troy?
My grief was at the height before thou camest,
And now like Nilus, it disdaineth bounds.
Give me a sword, I&apos;ll chop off my hands too;
For they have fought for Rome, and all in vain;
And they have nursed this woe, in feeding life;
In bootless prayer have they been held up,
And they have served me to effectless use:
Now all the service I require of them
Is that the one will help to cut the other.
&apos;Tis well, Lavinia, that thou hast no hands;
For hands, to do Rome service, are but vain.</string>

Titus recounts the tragedies his family has endured: two of his sons are dead, one is banished, his brother has discovered his daughter, who has had her tongue and hands taken from her and her husband killed, and is unable to name her attacker or speak out for her brothers. He wonders if his brother, his son, and himself should cut away their own tongues and hands like Lavinia. </string>

		<string>It was my deer; and he that wounded her
Hath hurt me more than had he killed me dead:
For now I stand as one upon a rock
Environed with a wilderness of sea,
Who marks the waxing tide grow wave by wave,
Expecting ever when some envious surge
Will in his brinish bowels swallow him.
This way to death my wretched sons are gone;
Here stands my other son, a banished man,
And here my brother, weeping at my woes.
But that which gives my soul the greatest spurn,
Is dear Lavinia, dearer than my soul.
Had I but seen thy picture in this plight,
It would have madded me: what shall I do
Now I behold thy lively body so?
Thou hast no hands, to wipe away thy tears:
Nor tongue, to tell me who hath martyr&apos;d thee:
Thy husband he is dead: and for his death
Thy brothers are condemn&apos;d, and dead by this.
Look, Marcus! ah, son Lucius, look on her!
When I did name her brothers, then fresh tears
Stood on her cheeks, as doth the honey-dew
Upon a gather&apos;d lily almost wither&apos;d.

[Perchance she weeps because they kill&apos;d her husband;
Perchance because she knows them innocent.]

If they did kill thy husband, then be joyful
Because the law hath ta&apos;en revenge on them.
No, no, they would not do so foul a deed;
Witness the sorrow that their sister makes.
Gentle Lavinia, let me kiss thy lips.
Or make some sign how I may do thee ease:
Shall thy good uncle, and thy brother Lucius,
And thou, and I, sit round about some fountain,
Looking all downwards to behold our cheeks
How they are stain&apos;d, as meadows, yet not dry,
With miry slime left on them by a flood?
And in the fountain shall we gaze so long
Till the fresh taste be taken from that clearness,
And made a brine-pit with our bitter tears?
Or shall we cut away our hands, like thine?
Or shall we bite our tongues, and in dumb shows
Pass the remainder of our hateful days?
What shall we do? let us, that have our tongues,
Plot some deuce of further misery,
To make us wonder&apos;d at in time to come.</string>

		<string>Is not my sorrow deep, having no bottom?
Then be my passions bottomless with them.

[But yet let reason govern thy lament.]

If there were reason for these miseries,
Then into limits could I bind my woes:
When heaven doth weep, doth not the earth o&apos;erflow?
If the winds rage, doth not the sea wax mad,
Threatening the welkin with his big-swoln face?
And wilt thou have a reason for this coil?
I am the sea; hark, how her sighs do blow!
She is the weeping welkin, I the earth:
Then must my sea be moved with her sighs;
Then must my earth with her continual tears
Become a deluge, overflow&apos;d and drown&apos;d;
For why my bowels cannot hide her woes,
But like a drunkard must I vomit them.
Then give me leave, for losers will have leave
To ease their stomachs with their bitter tongues.</string>

Titus has realized he was tricked by Aaron into having his hand cut off to save his sons when his sons&apos; heads are brought before him. He laughs, since so many tragic things have occurred that he is out of tears. He tells Marcus to carry one son&apos;s head, while he himself carries the other; he tells Lavinia to carry his dismembered hand in her mouth. He tells Lucius to raise an army among the Goths, and plans to take revenge against Saturninus, Aaron, and Tamora.</string>

Why, I have not another tear to shed:
Besides, this sorrow is an enemy,
And would usurp upon my watery eyes
And make them blind with tributary tears:
Then which way shall I find Revenge&apos;s cave?
For these two heads do seem to speak to me,
And threat me I shall never come to bliss
Till all these mischiefs be return&apos;d again
Even in their throats that have committed them.
Come, let me see what task I have to do.
You heavy people, circle me about,
That I may turn me to each one of you,
And swear unto my soul to right your wrongs.
The vow is made. Come, brother, take a head;
And in this hand the other I will bear.
Lavinia, thou shalt be employ&apos;d: these arms!
Bear thou my hand, sweet wench, between thy teeth.
As for thee, boy, go get thee from my sight;
Thou art an exile, and thou must not stay:
Hie to the Goths, and raise an army there:
And, if you love me, as I think you do,
Let&apos;s kiss and part, for we have much to do.</string>

Why, Marcus, no man should be mad but I.
What violent hands can she lay on her life?
Ah, wherefore dost thou urge the name of hands;
To bid AEneas tell the tale twice o&apos;er,
How Troy was burnt and he made miserable?
O, handle not the theme, to talk of hands,
Lest we remember still that we have none.
Fie, fie, how franticly I square my talk,
As if we should forget we had no hands,
If Marcus did not name the word of hands!
Come, let&apos;s fall to; and, gentle girl, eat this:
Here is no drink! Hark, Marcus, what she says;
I can interpret all her martyr&apos;d signs;
She says she drinks no other drink but tears,
Brew&apos;d with her sorrow, mesh&apos;d upon her cheeks:
Speechless complainer, I will learn thy thought;
In thy dumb action will I be as perfect
As begging hermits in their holy prayers:
Thou shalt not sigh, nor hold thy stumps to heaven,
Nor wink, nor nod, nor kneel, nor make a sign,
But I of these will wrest an alphabet
And by still practise learn to know thy meaning.</string>

		<string>Why, there&apos;s the privilege your beauty bears:
Fie, treacherous hue, that will betray with blushing
The close enacts and counsels of the heart!
Here&apos;s a young lad framed of another leer:
Look, how the black slave smiles upon the father,
As who should say &apos;Old lad, I am thine own.&apos;
He is your brother, lords, sensibly fed
Of that self-blood that first gave life to you,
And from that womb where you imprison&apos;d were
He is enfranchised and come to light:
Nay, he is your brother by the surer side,
Although my seal be stamped in his face.</string>

Aaron tells Tamora&apos;s sons that he killed the nurse so she could not reveal his plan: he will bring he and Tamora&apos;s newborn son to a friend, and switch him with their own baby. That way, he baby can be passed off as Tamora&apos;s son and be presented as an heir to the Roman emperor. He asks Tamora&apos;s other sons to bring the midwife, so Aaron can kill her, too.</string>

		<string>O Lord, sir, &apos;tis a deed of policy:
Shall she live to betray this guilt of ours,
A long-tongued babbling gossip? no, lords, no:
And now be it known to you my full intent.
Not far, one Muli lives, my countryman;
His wife but yesternight was brought to bed;
His child is like to her, fair as you are:
Go pack with him, and give the mother gold,
And tell them both the circumstance of all;
And how by this their child shall be advanced,
And be received for the emperor&apos;s heir,
And substituted in the place of mine,
To calm this tempest whirling in the court;
And let the emperor dandle him for his own.
Hark ye, lords; ye see I have given her physic,

[pointing to the nurse]

And you must needs bestow her funeral;
The fields are near, and you are gallant grooms:
This done, see that you take no longer days,
But send the midwife presently to me.
The midwife and the nurse well made away,
Then let the ladies tattle what they please.</string>

Sir boy, now let me see your archery;
Look ye draw home enough, and &apos;tis there straight.

Be you remember&apos;d, Marcus, she&apos;s gone, she&apos;s fled.
Sirs, take you to your tools. You, cousins, shall
Go sound the ocean, and cast your nets;
Happily you may catch her in the sea;
Yet there&apos;s as little justice as at land:
No; Publius and Sempronius, you must do it;
&apos;Tis you must dig with mattock and with spade,
And pierce the inmost centre of the earth:
Then, when you come to Pluto&apos;s region,
I pray you, deliver him this petition;
Tell him, it is for justice and for aid,
And that it comes from old Andronicus,
Shaken with sorrows in ungrateful Rome.
Ah, Rome! Well, well; I made thee miserable
What time I threw the people&apos;s suffrages
On him that thus doth tyrannize o&apos;er me.
Go, get you gone; and pray be careful all,
And leave you not a man-of-war unsearch&apos;d:
This wicked emperor may have shipp&apos;d her hence;
And, kinsmen, then we may go pipe for justice.</string>

An emperor in Rome thus overborne,
Troubled, confronted thus; and, for the extent
Of egal justice, used in such contempt?
My lords, you know, as know the mightful gods,
However these disturbers of our peace
Buz in the people&apos;s ears, there nought hath pass&apos;d,
But even with law, against the willful sons
Of old Andronicus. And what an if
His sorrows have so overwhelm&apos;d his wits,
Shall we be thus afflicted in his wreaks,
His fits, his frenzy, and his bitterness?
And now he writes to heaven for his redress:
See, here&apos;s to Jove, and this to Mercury;
This to Apollo; this to the god of war;
Sweet scrolls to fly about the streets of Rome!
What&apos;s this but libelling against the senate,
And blazoning our injustice every where?
A goodly humour, is it not, my lords?
As who would say, in Rome no justice were.
But if I live, his feigned ecstasies
Shall be no shelter to these outrages:
But he and his shall know that justice lives
In Saturninus&apos; health, whom, if she sleep,
He&apos;ll so awake as she in fury shall
Cut off the proud&apos;st conspirator that lives.</string>

[Ay, but the citizens favor Lucius,
And will revolt from me to succor him.]

King, be thy thoughts imperious, like thy name.
Is the sun dimm&apos;d, that gnats do fly in it?
The eagle suffers little birds to sing,
And is not careful what they mean thereby,
Knowing that with the shadow of his wings
He can at pleasure stint their melody:
Even so mayst thou the giddy men of Rome.
Then cheer thy spirit : for know, thou emperor,
I will enchant the old Andronicus
With words more sweet, and yet more dangerous,
Than baits to fish, or honey-stalks to sheep,
When as the one is wounded with the bait,
The other rotted with delicious feed.

[But he will not entreat his son for us.]

If Tamora entreat him, then he will:
For I can smooth and fill his aged ear
With golden promises; that, were his heart
Almost impregnable, his old ears deaf,
Yet should both ear and heart obey my tongue.</string>

To gaze upon a ruinous monastery;
And, as I earnestly did fix mine eye
Upon the wasted building, suddenly
I heard a child cry underneath a wall.
I made unto the noise; when soon I heard
The crying babe controll&apos;d with this discourse:
&apos;Peace, tawny slave, half me and half thy dam!
Did not thy hue bewray whose brat thou art,
Had nature lent thee but thy mother&apos;s look,
Villain, thou mightst have been an emperor:
But where the bull and cow are both milk-white,
They never do beget a coal-black calf.
Peace, villain, peace!&apos;--even thus he rates
the babe,--
&apos;For I must bear thee to a trusty Goth;
Who, when he knows thou art the empress&apos; babe,
Will hold thee dearly for thy mother&apos;s sake.&apos;
With this, my weapon drawn, I rush&apos;d upon him,
Surprised him suddenly, and brought him hither,
To use as you think needful of the man.</string>

		<string>First know thou, I begot him on the empress.

[O most insatiate and luxurious woman!]

Tut, Lucius, this was but a deed of charity
To that which thou shalt hear of me anon.
&apos;Twas her two sons that murder&apos;d Bassianus;
They cut thy sister&apos;s tongue and ravish&apos;d her
And cut her hands and trimm&apos;d her as thou saw&apos;st.

[O detestable villain! call&apos;st thou that trimming?]

Why, she was wash&apos;d and cut and trimm&apos;d, and &apos;twas
Trim sport for them that had the doing of it.

[O barbarous, beastly villains, like thyself!]

Indeed, I was their tutor to instruct them:
That codding spirit had they from their mother,
As sure a card as ever won the set;
That bloody mind, I think, they learn&apos;d of me,
As true a dog as ever fought at head.
Well, let my deeds be witness of my worth.
I train&apos;d thy brethren to that guileful hole
Where the dead corpse of Bassianus lay:
I wrote the letter that thy father found
And hid the gold within the letter mention&apos;d,
Confederate with the queen and her two sons:
And what not done, that thou hast cause to rue,
Wherein I had no stroke of mischief in it?
I play&apos;d the cheater for thy father&apos;s hand,
And, when I had it, drew myself apart
And almost broke my heart with extreme laughter:
I pry&apos;d me through the crevice of a wall
When, for his hand, he had his two sons&apos; heads;
Beheld his tears, and laugh&apos;d so heartily,
That both mine eyes were rainy like to his :
And when I told the empress of this sport,
She swooned almost at my pleasing tale,
And for my tidings gave me twenty kisses.

[What, canst thou say all this, and never blush?]

Ay, like a black dog, as the saying is.

[Art thou not sorry for these heinous deeds?]

Ay, that I had not done a thousand more.
Even now I curse the day--and yet, I think,
Few come within the compass of my curse,--
Wherein I did not some notorious ill,
As kill a man, or else devise his death,
Ravish a maid, or plot the way to do it,
Accuse some innocent and forswear myself,
Set deadly enmity between two friends,
Make poor men&apos;s cattle break their necks;
Set fire on barns and hay-stacks in the night,
And bid the owners quench them with their tears.
Oft have I digg&apos;d up dead men from their graves,
And set them upright at their dear friends&apos; doors,
Even when their sorrows almost were forgot;
And on their skins, as on the bark of trees,
Have with my knife carved in Roman letters,
&apos;Let not your sorrow die, though I am dead.&apos;
Tut, I have done a thousand dreadful things
As willingly as one would kill a fly,
And nothing grieves me heartily indeed
But that I cannot do ten thousand more.

[Bring down the devil; for he must not die
So sweet a death as hanging presently.]

If there be devils, would I were a devil,
To live and burn in everlasting fire,
So I might have your company in hell,
But to torment you with my bitter tongue!</string>

No vast obscurity or misty vale,

Can couch for fear, but I will find them out;
And in their ears tell them my dreadful name,
Revenge, which makes the foul offender quake.</string>

O villains, Chiron and Demetrius!
Here stands the spring whom you have stain&apos;d with mud,
This goodly summer with your winter mix&apos;d.
You kill&apos;d her husband, and for that vile fault
Two of her brothers were condemn&apos;d to death,
My hand cut off and made a merry jest;
Both her sweet hands, her tongue, and that more dear
Than hands or tongue, her spotless chastity,
Inhuman traitors, you constrain&apos;d and forced.
What would you say, if I should let you speak?
Villains, for shame you could not beg for grace.
Hark, wretches! how I mean to martyr you.
This one hand yet is left to cut your throats,
Whilst that Lavinia &apos;tween her stumps doth hold
The basin that receives your guilty blood.
You know your mother means to feast with me,
And calls herself Revenge, and thinks me mad:
Hark, villains! I will grind your bones to dust
And with your blood and it I&apos;ll make a paste,
And of the paste a coffin I will rear
And make two pasties of your shameful heads,
And bid that strumpet, your unhallow&apos;d dam,
Like to the earth swallow her own increase.
This is the feast that I have bid her to,
And this the banquet she shall surfeit on;
For worse than Philomel you used my daughter,
And worse than Progne I will be revenged:
And now prepare your throats. Lavinia, come,

[he cuts their throats]

Receive the blood: and when that they are dead,
Let me go grind their bones to powder small
And with this hateful liquor temper it;
And in that paste let their vile heads be baked.
Come, come, be every one officious
To make this banquet; which I wish may prove
More stern and bloody than the Centaurs&apos; feast.
So, now bring them in, for I&apos;ll play the cook,
And see them ready &apos;gainst their mother comes.</string>

By uproar sever&apos;d, like a flight of fowl
Scatter&apos;d by winds and high tempestuous gusts,
O, let me teach you how to knit again
This scatter&apos;d corn into one mutual sheaf,
These broken limbs again into one body;
Lest Rome herself be bane unto herself,
And she whom mighty kingdoms court&apos;sy to,
Like a forlorn and desperate castaway,
Do shameful execution on herself.
But if my frosty signs and chaps of age,
Grave witnesses of true experience,
Cannot induce you to attend my words,

[to LUCIUS]

Speak, Rome&apos;s dear friend, as erst our ancestor,
When with his solemn tongue he did discourse
To love-sick Dido&apos;s sad attending ear
The story of that baleful burning night
When subtle Greeks surprised King Priam&apos;s Troy,
Tell us what Sinon hath bewitch&apos;d our ears,
Or who hath brought the fatal engine in
That gives our Troy, our Rome, the civil wound.
My heart is not compact of flint nor steel;
Nor can I utter all our bitter grief,
But floods of tears will drown my oratory,
And break my utterance, even in the time
When it should move you to attend me most,
Lending your kind commiseration.
Here is a captain, let him tell the tale;
Your hearts will throb and weep to hear him speak.</string>

The issue of an irreligious Moor,
Chief architect and plotter of these woes:
The villain is alive in Titus&apos; house,
And as he is, to witness this is true.
Now judge what cause had Titus to revenge
These wrongs, unspeakable, past patience,
Or more than any living man could bear.
Now you have heard the truth, what say you, Romans?
Have we done aught amiss,--show us wherein,
And, from the place where you behold us now,
The poor remainder of Andronici
Will, hand in hand, all headlong cast us down.
And on the ragged stones beat forth our brains,
And make a mutual closure of our house.
Speak, Romans, speak; and if you say we shall,
Lo, hand in hand, Lucius and I will fall.</string>

There let him stand, and rave, and cry for food;
If any one relieves or pities him,
For the offence he dies. This is our doom:
Some stay to see him fasten&apos;d in the earth.

[O, why should wrath be mute, and fury dumb?
I am no baby, I, that with base prayers
I should repent the evils I have done:
Ten thousand worse than ever yet I did
Would I perform, if I might have my will;
If one good deed in all my life I did,
I do repent it from my very soul.]

Some loving friends convey the emperor hence,
And give him burial in his father&apos;s grave:
My father and Lavinia shall forthwith
Be closed in our household&apos;s monument.
As for that heinous tiger, Tamora,
No funeral rite, nor man in mourning weeds,
No mournful bell shall ring her burial;
But throw her forth to beasts and birds of prey:
Her life was beast-like, and devoid of pity;
And, being so, shall have like want of pity.
See justice done on Aaron, that damn&apos;d Moor,
By whom our heavy haps had their beginning:
Then, afterwards, to order well the state,
That like events may ne&apos;er it ruinate.</string>

But truth is truth: large lengths of seas and shores
Between my father and my mother lay,
As I have heard my father speak himself,
When this same lusty gentleman was got.
Upon his death-bed he by will bequeath&apos;d
His lands to me, and took it on his death
That this my mother&apos;s son was none of his;
And if he were, he came into the world
Full fourteen weeks before the course of time.

My father&apos;s land, as was my father&apos;s will.</string>

		<string>There is an old tale goes that Herne the hunter,
Sometime a keeper here in Windsor forest,
Doth all the winter-time, at still midnight,
Walk round about an oak, with great ragg&apos;d horns;
And there he blasts the tree and takes the cattle
And makes milch-kine yield blood and shakes a chain
In a most hideous and dreadful manner:
You have heard of such a spirit, and well you know
The superstitious idle-headed eld
Received and did deliver to our age
This tale of Herne the hunter for a truth.

[Why, yet there want not many that do fear
In deep of night to walk by this Herne&apos;s oak:
But what of this?]

Marry, this is our device;
That Falstaff at that oak shall meet with us.

[Well, let it not be doubted but he&apos;ll come:
And in this shape when you have brought him thither,
What shall be done with him? what is your plot?]

That likewise have we thought upon, and thus:
Nan Page my daughter and my little son
And three or four more of their growth we&apos;ll dress
Like urchins, ouphes and fairies, green and white,
With rounds of waxen tapers on their heads,
And rattles in their hands: upon a sudden,
As Falstaff, she and I, are newly met,
Let them from forth a sawpit rush at once
With some diffused song: upon their sight,
We two in great amazedness will fly:
Then let them all encircle him about
And, fairy-like, to-pinch the unclean knight,
And ask him why, that hour of fairy revel,
In their so sacred paths he dares to tread
In shape profane.</string>

But from the inward motion to deliver
Sweet, sweet, sweet poison for the age&apos;s tooth:
Which, though I will not practise to deceive,
Yet, to avoid deceit, I mean to learn;
For it shall strew the footsteps of my rising.

When King John offers peace to France so long as his reign is accepted, King Phillip says that he, too, wishes for peace, and will accept England&apos;s rule in France, but only of the English troops withdraw and Arthur, the son of King John&apos;s elder brother, is made the new King of England.</string>

From France to England, there to live in peace.
England we love; and for that England&apos;s sake
With burden of our armour here we sweat.
This toil of ours should be a work of thine;
But thou from loving England art so far,
That thou hast under-wrought his lawful king
Cut off the sequence of posterity,
Out-faced infant state and done a rape
Upon the maiden virtue of the crown.
Look here upon thy brother Geffrey&apos;s face;
These eyes, these brows, were moulded out of his:
This little abstract doth contain that large
Which died in Geffrey, and the hand of time
Shall draw this brief into as huge a volume.
That Geffrey was thy elder brother born,
And this his son; England was Geffrey&apos;s right
And this is Geffrey&apos;s: in the name of God
How comes it then that thou art call&apos;d a king,
When living blood doth in these temples beat,
Which owe the crown that thou o&apos;ermasterest?</string>

You men of Angiers, and my loving subjects--

[You loving men of Angiers, Arthur&apos;s subjects,
Our trumpet call&apos;d you to this gentle parle--]

For our advantage; therefore hear us first.
These flags of France, that are advanced here
Before the eye and prospect of your town,
Have hither march&apos;d to your endamagement:
The cannons have their bowels full of wrath,
And ready mounted are they to spit forth
Their iron indignation &apos;gainst your walls:
All preparation for a bloody siege
All merciless proceeding by these French
Confronts your city&apos;s eyes, your winking gates;
And but for our approach those sleeping stones,
That as a waist doth girdle you about,
By the compulsion of their ordinance
By this time from their fixed beds of lime
Had been dishabited, and wide havoc made
For bloody power to rush upon your peace.
But on the sight of us your lawful king,
Who painfully with much expedient march
Have brought a countercheque before your gates,
To save unscratch&apos;d your city&apos;s threatened cheeks,
Behold, the French amazed vouchsafe a parle;
And now, instead of bullets wrapp&apos;d in fire,
To make a shaking fever in your walls,
They shoot but calm words folded up in smoke,
To make a faithless error in your ears:
Which trust accordingly, kind citizens,
And let us in, your king, whose labour&apos;d spirits,
Forwearied in this action of swift speed,
Crave harbourage within your city walls.</string>

Hither return all gilt with Frenchmen&apos;s blood;

That is removed by a staff of France;

That did display them when we first march&apos;d forth;
And, like a troop of jolly huntsmen, come
Our lusty English, all with purpled hands,
Dyed in the dying slaughter of their foes:
Open your gates and gives the victors way.</string>

And stand securely on their battlements,
As in a theatre, whence they gape and point
At your industrious scenes and acts of death.
Your royal presences be ruled by me:
Do like the mutines of Jerusalem,
Be friends awhile and both conjointly bend
Your sharpest deeds of malice on this town:
By east and west let France and England mount
Their battering cannon charged to the mouths,
Till their soul-fearing clamours have brawl&apos;d down
The flinty ribs of this contemptuous city:
I&apos;ld play incessantly upon these jades,
Even till unfenced desolation
Leave them as naked as the vulgar air.
That done, dissever your united strengths,
And part your mingled colours once again;
Turn face to face and bloody point to point;
Then, in a moment, Fortune shall cull forth
Out of one side her happy minion,
To whom in favour she shall give the day,
And kiss him with a glorious victory.
How like you this wild counsel, mighty states?
Smacks it not something of the policy?</string>

		<string>From time to time I have acquainted you
With the dear love I bear to fair Anne Page;
Who mutually hath answer&apos;d my affection,
So far forth as herself might be her chooser,
Even to my wish: I have a letter from her
Of such contents as you will wonder at;
The mirth whereof so larded with my matter,
That neither singly can be manifested,
Without the show of both; fat Falstaff
Hath a great scene: the image of the jest
I&apos;ll show you here at large. Hark, good mine host.
To-night at Herne&apos;s oak, just &apos;twixt twelve and one,
Must my sweet Nan present the Fairy Queen;
The purpose why, is here: in which disguise,
While other jests are something rank on foot,
Her father hath commanded her to slip
Away with Slender and with him at Eton
Immediately to marry: she hath consented: Now, sir,
Her mother, ever strong against that match
And firm for Doctor Caius, hath appointed
That he shall likewise shuffle her away,
While other sports are tasking of their minds,
And at the deanery, where a priest attends,
Straight marry her: to this her mother&apos;s plot
She seemingly obedient likewise hath
Made promise to the doctor. Now, thus it rests:
Her father means she shall be all in white,
And in that habit, when Slender sees his time
To take her by the hand and bid her go,
She shall go with him: her mother hath intended,
The better to denote her to the doctor,
For they must all be mask&apos;d and vizarded,
That quaint in green she shall be loose enrobed,
With ribands pendent, flaring &apos;bout her head;
And when the doctor spies his vantage ripe,
To pinch her by the hand, and, on that token,
The maid hath given consent to go with him.

[Which means she to deceive, father or mother?]

Both, my good host, to go along with me:
And here it rests, that you&apos;ll procure the vicar
To stay for me at church &apos;twixt twelve and one,
And, in the lawful name of marrying,
To give our hearts united ceremony.</string>

		<string>That daughter there of Spain, the Lady Blanch,
Is niece to England: look upon the years
Of Lewis the Dauphin and that lovely maid:
If lusty love should go in quest of beauty,
Where should he find it fairer than in Blanch?
If zealous love should go in search of virtue,
Where should he find it purer than in Blanch?
If love ambitious sought a match of birth,
Whose veins bound richer blood than Lady Blanch?
Such as she is, in beauty, virtue, birth,
Is the young Dauphin every way complete:
If not complete of, say he is not she;
And she again wants nothing, to name want,
If want it be not that she is not he:
He is the half part of a blessed man,
Left to be finished by such as she;
And she a fair divided excellence,
Whose fulness of perfection lies in him.
O, two such silver currents, when they join,
Do glorify the banks that bound them in;
And two such shores to two such streams made one,
Two such controlling bounds shall you be, kings,
To these two princes, if you marry them.
This union shall do more than battery can
To our fast-closed gates; for at this match,
With swifter spleen than powder can enforce,
The mouth of passage shall we fling wide ope,
And give you entrance: but without this match,
The sea enraged is not half so deaf,
Lions more confident, mountains and rocks
More free from motion, no, not Death himself
In moral fury half so peremptory,
As we to keep this city.</string>

John, to stop Arthur&apos;s title in the whole,
Hath willingly departed with a part,
And France, whose armour conscience buckled on,
Whom zeal and charity brought to the field
As God&apos;s own soldier, rounded in the ear
With that same purpose-changer, that sly devil,
That broker, that still breaks the pate of faith,
That daily break-vow, he that wins of all,
Of kings, of beggars, old men, young men, maids,
Who, having no external thing to lose
But the word &apos;maid,&apos; cheats the poor maid of that,
That smooth-faced gentleman, tickling Commodity,
Commodity, the bias of the world,
The world, who of itself is peised well,
Made to run even upon even ground,
Till this advantage, this vile-drawing bias,
This sway of motion, this Commodity,
Makes it take head from all indifferency,
From all direction, purpose, course, intent:
And this same bias, this Commodity,
This bawd, this broker, this all-changing word,
Clapp&apos;d on the outward eye of fickle France,
Hath drawn him from his own determined aid,
From a resolved and honourable war,
To a most base and vile-concluded peace.
And why rail I on this Commodity?
But for because he hath not woo&apos;d me yet:
Not that I have the power to clutch my hand,
When his fair angels would salute my palm;
But for my hand, as unattempted yet,
Like a poor beggar, raileth on the rich.
Well, whiles I am a beggar, I will rail
And say there is no sin but to be rich;
And being rich, my virtue then shall be
To say there is no vice but beggary.
Since kings break faith upon commodity,
Gain, be my lord, for I will worship thee.</string>

But they will quake and tremble all this day.

Why dost thou look so sadly on my son?
What means that hand upon that breast of thine?
Why holds thine eye that lamentable rheum,
Like a proud river peering o&apos;er his bounds?
Be these sad signs confirmers of thy words?
Then speak again; not all thy former tale,
But this one word, whether thy tale be true.

[As true as I believe you think them false
That give you cause to prove my saying true.]

O, if thou teach me to believe this sorrow,
Teach thou this sorrow how to make me die,
And let belief and life encounter so
As doth the fury of two desperate men
Which in the very meeting fall and die.
Lewis marry Blanch! O boy, then where art thou?
France friend with England, what becomes of me?
Fellow, be gone: I cannot brook thy sight:

Have I not pawn&apos;d to you my majesty?]

You have beguiled me with a counterfeit
Resembling majesty, which, being touch&apos;d and tried,
Proves valueless: you are forsworn, forsworn;
You came in arms to spill mine enemies&apos; blood,
But now in arms you strengthen it with yours:
The grappling vigour and rough frown of war
Is cold in amity and painted peace,
And our oppression hath made up this league.
Arm, arm, you heavens, against these perjured kings!
A widow cries; be husband to me, heavens!
Let not the hours of this ungodly day
Wear out the day in peace; but, ere sunset,
Set armed discord &apos;twixt these perjured kings!
Hear me, O, hear me!

[Lady Constance, peace!]

War! war! no peace! peace is to me a war
O Lymoges! O Austria! thou dost shame
That bloody spoil: thou slave, thou wretch, thou coward!
Thou little valiant, great in villany!
Thou ever strong upon the stronger side!
Thou Fortune&apos;s champion that dost never fight
But when her humorous ladyship is by
To teach thee safety! thou art perjured too,
And soothest up greatness. What a fool art thou,
A ramping fool, to brag and stamp and swear
Upon my party! Thou cold-blooded slave,
Hast thou not spoke like thunder on my side,
Been sworn my soldier, bidding me depend
Upon thy stars, thy fortune and thy strength,
And dost thou now fall over to my fores?
Thou wear a lion&apos;s hide! doff it for shame,
And hang a calf&apos;s-skin on those recreant limbs.</string>

Can task the free breath of a sacred king?
Thou canst not, cardinal, devise a name
So slight, unworthy and ridiculous,
To charge me to an answer, as the pope.
Tell him this tale; and from the mouth of England
Add thus much more, that no Italian priest
Shall tithe or toll in our dominions;
But as we, under heaven, are supreme head,
So under Him that great supremacy,
Where we do reign, we will alone uphold,
Without the assistance of a mortal hand:
So tell the pope, all reverence set apart
To him and his usurp&apos;d authority.

[Brother of England, you blaspheme in this.]

Though you and all the kings of Christendom
Are led so grossly by this meddling priest,
Dreading the curse that money may buy out;
And by the merit of vile gold, dross, dust,
Purchase corrupted pardon of a man,
Who in that sale sells pardon from himself,
Though you and all the rest so grossly led
This juggling witchcraft with revenue cherish,
Yet I alone, alone do me oppose
Against the pope and count his friends my foes.

[What canst thou say but will perplex thee more,
If thou stand excommunicate and cursed?]

Good reverend father, make my person yours,
And tell me how you would bestow yourself.
This royal hand and mine are newly knit,
And the conjunction of our inward souls
Married in league, coupled and linked together
With all religious strength of sacred vows;
The latest breath that gave the sound of words
Was deep-sworn faith, peace, amity, true love
Between our kingdoms and our royal selves,
And even before this truce, but new before,
No longer than we well could wash our hands
To clap this royal bargain up of peace,
Heaven knows, they were besmear&apos;d and over-stain&apos;d
With slaughter&apos;s pencil, where revenge did paint
The fearful difference of incensed kings:
And shall these hands, so lately purged of blood,
So newly join&apos;d in love, so strong in both,
Unyoke this seizure and this kind regreet?
Play fast and loose with faith? so jest with heaven,
Make such unconstant children of ourselves,
As now again to snatch our palm from palm,
Unswear faith sworn, and on the marriage-bed
Of smiling peace to march a bloody host,
And make a riot on the gentle brow
Of true sincerity? O, holy sir,
My reverend father, let it not be so!
Out of your grace, devise, ordain, impose
Some gentle order; and then we shall be blest
To do your pleasure and continue friends.</string>

		<string>All form is formless, order orderless,
Save what is opposite to England&apos;s love.
Therefore to arms! be champion of our church,
Or let the church, our mother, breathe her curse,
A mother&apos;s curse, on her revolting son.
France, thou mayst hold a serpent by the tongue,
A chafed lion by the mortal paw,
A fasting tiger safer by the tooth,
Than keep in peace that hand which thou dost hold.

[I may disjoin my hand, but not my faith.]

So makest thou faith an enemy to faith;
And like a civil war set&apos;st oath to oath,
Thy tongue against thy tongue. O, let thy vow
First made to heaven, first be to heaven perform&apos;d,
That is, to be the champion of our church!
What since thou sworest is sworn against thyself
And may not be performed by thyself,
For that which thou hast sworn to do amiss
Is not amiss when it is truly done,
And being not done, where doing tends to ill,
The truth is then most done not doing it:
The better act of purposes mistook
Is to mistake again; though indirect,
Yet indirection thereby grows direct,
And falsehood falsehood cures, as fire cools fire
Within the scorched veins of one new-burn&apos;d.
It is religion that doth make vows kept;
But thou hast sworn against religion,
By what thou swear&apos;st against the thing thou swear&apos;st,
And makest an oath the surety for thy truth
Against an oath: the truth thou art unsure
To swear, swears only not to be forsworn;
Else what a mockery should it be to swear!
But thou dost swear only to be forsworn;
And most forsworn, to keep what thou dost swear.
Therefore thy later vows against thy first
Is in thyself rebellion to thyself;
And better conquest never canst thou make
Than arm thy constant and thy nobler parts
Against these giddy loose suggestions:
Upon which better part our prayers come in,
If thou vouchsafe them. But if not, then know
The peril of our curses light on thee
So heavy as thou shalt not shake them off,
But in despair die under their black weight.</string>

		<string>Come hither, Hubert. O my gentle Hubert,
We owe thee much! within this wall of flesh
There is a soul counts thee her creditor
And with advantage means to pay thy love:
And my good friend, thy voluntary oath
Lives in this bosom, dearly cherished.
Give me thy hand. I had a thing to say,
But I will fit it with some better time.
By heaven, Hubert, I am almost ashamed
To say what good respect I have of thee.

[I am much bounden to your majesty.]

Good friend, thou hast no cause to say so yet,
But thou shalt have; and creep time ne&apos;er so slow,
Yet it shall come from me to do thee good.
I had a thing to say, but let it go:
The sun is in the heaven, and the proud day,
Attended with the pleasures of the world,
Is all too wanton and too full of gawds
To give me audience: if the midnight bell
Did, with his iron tongue and brazen mouth,
Sound on into the drowsy race of night;
If this same were a churchyard where we stand,
And thou possessed with a thousand wrongs,
Or if that surly spirit, melancholy,
Had baked thy blood and made it heavy-thick,
Which else runs tickling up and down the veins,
Making that idiot, laughter, keep men&apos;s eyes
And strain their cheeks to idle merriment,
A passion hateful to my purposes,
Or if that thou couldst see me without eyes,
Hear me without thine ears, and make reply
Without a tongue, using conceit alone,
Without eyes, ears and harmful sound of words;
Then, in despite of brooded watchful day,
I would into thy bosom pour my thoughts:
But, ah, I will not! yet I love thee well;
And, by my troth, I think thou lovest me well.

[So well, that what you bid me undertake,
Though that my death were adjunct to my act,
By heaven, I would do it.]

Do not I know thou wouldst?
Good Hubert, Hubert, Hubert, throw thine eye
On yon young boy: I&apos;ll tell thee what, my friend,
He is a very serpent in my way;
And whereso&apos;er this foot of mine doth tread,
He lies before me: dost thou understand me?
Thou art his keeper.</string>

And not bethink me straight of dangerous rocks,
Which touching but my gentle vessel&apos;s side,
Would scatter all her spices on the stream,
Enrobe the roaring waters with my silks,

[Patience, good lady! comfort, gentle Constance!]

No, I defy all counsel, all redress,
But that which ends all counsel, true redress,
Death, death; O amiable lovely death!
Thou odouriferous stench! sound rottenness!
Arise forth from the couch of lasting night,
Thou hate and terror to prosperity,
And I will kiss thy detestable bones
And put my eyeballs in thy vaulty brows
And ring these fingers with thy household worms
And stop this gap of breath with fulsome dust
And be a carrion monster like thyself:
Come, grin on me, and I will think thou smilest
And buss thee as thy wife. Misery&apos;s love,
O, come to me!

[O fair affliction, peace!]

No, no, I will not, having breath to cry:
O, that my tongue were in the thunder&apos;s mouth!
Then with a passion would I shake the world;
And rouse from sleep that fell anatomy
Which cannot hear a lady&apos;s feeble voice,
Which scorns a modern invocation.

[Lady, you utter madness, and not sorrow.]

Thou art not holy to belie me so;
I am not mad: this hair I tear is mine;
My name is Constance; I was Geffrey&apos;s wife;
Young Arthur is my son, and he is lost:
I am not mad: I would to heaven I were!
For then, &apos;tis like I should forget myself:
O, if I could, what grief should I forget!
Preach some philosophy to make me mad,
And thou shalt be canonized, cardinal;
For being not mad but sensible of grief,
My reasonable part produces reason
How I may be deliver&apos;d of these woes,
And teaches me to kill or hang myself:
If I were mad, I should forget my son,
Or madly think a babe of clouts were he:
I am not mad; too well, too well I feel
The different plague of each calamity.</string>

For since the birth of Cain, the first male child,
To him that did but yesterday suspire,
There was not such a gracious creature born.
But now will canker-sorrow eat my bud
And chase the native beauty from his cheek
And he will look as hollow as a ghost,
As dim and meagre as an ague&apos;s fit,
And so he&apos;ll die; and, rising so again,
When I shall meet him in the court of heaven
I shall not know him: therefore never, never
Must I behold my pretty Arthur more.</string>

Now hear me speak with a prophetic spirit;
For even the breath of what I mean to speak
Shall blow each dust, each straw, each little rub,
Out of the path which shall directly lead
Thy foot to England&apos;s throne; and therefore mark.
John hath seized Arthur; and it cannot be
That, whiles warm life plays in that infant&apos;s veins,
The misplaced John should entertain an hour,
One minute, nay, one quiet breath of rest.
A sceptre snatch&apos;d with an unruly hand
Must be as boisterously maintain&apos;d as gain&apos;d;
And he that stands upon a slippery place
Makes nice of no vile hold to stay him up:
That John may stand, then Arthur needs must fall;
So be it, for it cannot be but so.

[But what shall I gain by young Arthur&apos;s fall?]

You, in the right of Lady Blanch your wife,
May then make all the claim that Arthur did.

[And lose it, life and all, as Arthur did.]

How green you are and fresh in this old world!
John lays you plots; the times conspire with you;
For he that steeps his safety in true blood
Shall find but bloody safety and untrue.
This act so evilly born shall cool the hearts
Of all his people and freeze up their zeal,
That none so small advantage shall step forth
To cheque his reign, but they will cherish it;
No natural exhalation in the sky,
No scope of nature, no distemper&apos;d day,
No common wind, no customed event,
But they will pluck away his natural cause
And call them meteors, prodigies and signs,
Abortives, presages and tongues of heaven,
Plainly denouncing vengeance upon John.

[May be he will not touch young Arthur&apos;s life,
But hold himself safe in his prisonment.]

O, sir, when he shall hear of your approach,
If that young Arthur be not gone already,
Even at that news he dies; and then the hearts
Of all his people shall revolt from him
And kiss the lips of unacquainted change
And pick strong matter of revolt and wrath
Out of the bloody fingers&apos; ends of John.
Methinks I see this hurly all on foot:
And, O, what better matter breeds for you
Than I have named! The bastard Faulconbridge
Is now in England, ransacking the church,
Offending charity: if but a dozen French
Were there in arms, they would be as a call
To train ten thousand English to their side,
Or as a little snow, tumbled about,
Anon becomes a mountain. O noble Dauphin,
Go with me to the king: &apos;tis wonderful
What may be wrought out of their discontent,
Now that their souls are topful of offence.
For England go: I will whet on the king.</string>

		<string>Have you the heart? When your head did but ache,
I knit my handercher about your brows,
The best I had, a princess wrought it me,
And I did never ask it you again;
And with my hand at midnight held your head,
And like the watchful minutes to the hour,
Still and anon cheer&apos;d up the heavy time,
Saying, &apos;What lack you?&apos; and &apos;Where lies your grief?&apos;
Or &apos;What good love may I perform for you?&apos;
Many a poor man&apos;s son would have lien still
And ne&apos;er have spoke a loving word to you;
But you at your sick service had a prince.
Nay, you may think my love was crafty love
And call it cunning: do, an if you will:
If heaven be pleased that you must use me ill,
Why then you must. Will you put out mine eyes?
These eyes that never did nor never shall
So much as frown on you.

[I have sworn to do it;
And with hot irons must I burn them out.]

Ah, none but in this iron age would do it!
The iron of itself, though heat red-hot,
Approaching near these eyes, would drink my tears
And quench his fiery indignation
Even in the matter of mine innocence;
Nay, after that, consume away in rust
But for containing fire to harm mine eye.
Are you more stubborn-hard than hammer&apos;d iron?
An if an angel should have come to me
And told me Hubert should put out mine eyes,
I would not have believed him,--no tongue but Hubert&apos;s.</string>

To sound the purpose of all their hearts,

Doth move the murmuring lips of discontent

Why then your fears, which, as they say, attend
The steps of wrong, should move you to mew up

To grace occasions, let it be our suit
That you have bid us ask his liberty;

Than whereupon our weal, on you depending,
Counts it your weal he have his liberty.</string>

But as I travell&apos;d hither through the land,

Possess&apos;d with rumours, full of idle dreams,
Not knowing what they fear, but full of fear:
And here a prophet, that I brought with me
From forth the streets of Pomfret, whom I found
With many hundreds treading on his heels;
To whom he sung, in rude harsh-sounding rhymes,
That, ere the next Ascension-day at noon,
Your highness should deliver up your crown.</string>

		<string>My lord, they say five moons were seen to-night;
Four fixed, and the fifth did whirl about
The other four in wondrous motion.

[Five moons!]

Old men and beldams in the streets
Do prophesy upon it dangerously:
Young Arthur&apos;s death is common in their mouths:
And when they talk of him, they shake their heads
And whisper one another in the ear;
And he that speaks doth gripe the hearer&apos;s wrist,
Whilst he that hears makes fearful action,
With wrinkled brows, with nods, with rolling eyes.
I saw a smith stand with his hammer, thus,
The whilst his iron did on the anvil cool,
With open mouth swallowing a tailor&apos;s news;
Who, with his shears and measure in his hand,
Standing on slippers, which his nimble haste
Had falsely thrust upon contrary feet,
Told of a many thousand warlike French
That were embattailed and rank&apos;d in Kent:
Another lean unwash&apos;d artificer
Cuts off his tale and talks of Arthur&apos;s death.</string>

		<string>Why seek&apos;st thou to possess me with these fears?
Why urgest thou so oft young Arthur&apos;s death?
Thy hand hath murder&apos;d him: I had a mighty cause
To wish him dead, but thou hadst none to kill him.

[No had, my lord! why, did you not provoke me?]

It is the curse of kings to be attended
By slaves that take their humours for a warrant
To break within the bloody house of life,
And on the winking of authority
To understand a law, to know the meaning
Of dangerous majesty, when perchance it frowns
More upon humour than advised respect.

[Here is your hand and seal for what I did.]

O, when the last account &apos;twixt heaven and earth
Is to be made, then shall this hand and seal
Witness against us to damnation!
How oft the sight of means to do ill deeds
Make deeds ill done! Hadst not thou been by,
A fellow by the hand of nature mark&apos;d,
Quoted and sign&apos;d to do a deed of shame,
This murder had not come into my mind:
But taking note of thy abhorr&apos;d aspect,
Finding thee fit for bloody villany,
Apt, liable to be employ&apos;d in danger,
I faintly broke with thee of Arthur&apos;s death;
And thou, to be endeared to a king,
Made it no conscience to destroy a prince.

[My lord--]

Hadst thou but shook thy head or made a pause
When I spake darkly what I purposed,
Or turn&apos;d an eye of doubt upon my face,
As bid me tell my tale in express words,
Deep shame had struck me dumb, made me break off,
And those thy fears might have wrought fears in me:
But thou didst understand me by my signs
And didst in signs again parley with sin;
Yea, without stop, didst let thy heart consent,
And consequently thy rude hand to act
The deed, which both our tongues held vile to name.
Out of my sight, and never see me more!
My nobles leave me; and my state is braved,
Even at my gates, with ranks of foreign powers:
Nay, in the body of this fleshly land,
This kingdom, this confine of blood and breath,
Hostility and civil tumult reigns
Between my conscience and my cousin&apos;s death.</string>

Sleep when he wakes and creep into the jaundice

Do cream and mantle like a standing pond,
And do a wilful stillness entertain,
With purpose to be dress&apos;d in an opinion
Of wisdom, gravity, profound conceit,
As who should say &apos;I am Sir Oracle,
And when I ope my lips let no dog bark!&apos;
O my Antonio, I do know of these
That therefore only are reputed wise
For saying nothing; when, I am very sure,
If they should speak, would almost damn those ears,
Which, hearing them, would call their brothers fools.

But fish not, with this melancholy bait,
For this fool gudgeon, this opinion.

Beyond the infinite and boundless reach
Of mercy, if thou didst this deed of death,
Art thou damn&apos;d, Hubert.

[Do but hear me, sir.]

Ha! I&apos;ll tell thee what;
Thou&apos;rt damn&apos;d as black--nay, nothing is so black;
Thou art more deep damn&apos;d than Prince Lucifer:
There is not yet so ugly a fiend of hell
As thou shalt be, if thou didst kill this child.

[Upon my soul--]

If thou didst but consent
To this most cruel act, do but despair;
And if thou want&apos;st a cord, the smallest thread
That ever spider twisted from her womb
Will serve to strangle thee, a rush will be a beam
To hang thee on; or wouldst thou drown thyself,
Put but a little water in a spoon,
And it shall be as all the ocean,
Enough to stifle such a villain up.
I do suspect thee very grievously.

[If I in act, consent, or sin of thought,
Be guilty of the stealing that sweet breath
Which was embounded in this beauteous clay,
Let hell want pains enough to torture me.
I left him well.]

Go, bear him in thine arms.
I am amazed, methinks, and lose my way
Among the thorns and dangers of this world.
How easy dost thou take all England up!
From forth this morsel of dead royalty,
The life, the right and truth of all this realm
Is fled to heaven; and England now is left
To tug and scamble and to part by the teeth
The unowed interest of proud-swelling state.
Now for the bare-pick&apos;d bone of majesty
Doth dogged war bristle his angry crest
And snarleth in the gentle eyes of peace:
Now powers from home and discontents at home
Meet in one line; and vast confusion waits,
As doth a raven on a sick-fall&apos;n beast,
The imminent decay of wrested pomp.
Now happy he whose cloak and cincture can
Hold out this tempest. Bear away that child
And follow me with speed: I&apos;ll to the king:
A thousand businesses are brief in hand,
And heaven itself doth frown upon the land.</string>

Show boldness and aspiring confidence.

And fright him there? and make him tremble there?

To meet displeasure farther from the doors,
And grapple with him ere he comes so nigh.</string>

		<string>By all the blood that ever fury breathed,
The youth says well. Now hear our English king;
For thus his royalty doth speak in me.
He is prepared, and reason too he should:
This apish and unmannerly approach,
This harness&apos;d masque and unadvised revel,
This unhair&apos;d sauciness and boyish troops,
The king doth smile at; and is well prepared
To whip this dwarfish war, these pigmy arms,
From out the circle of his territories.
That hand which had the strength, even at your door,
To cudgel you and make you take the hatch,
To dive like buckets in concealed wells,
To crouch in litter of your stable planks,
To lie like pawns lock&apos;d up in chests and trunks,
To hug with swine, to seek sweet safety out
In vaults and prisons, and to thrill and shake
Even at the crying of your nation&apos;s crow,
Thinking his voice an armed Englishman;
Shall that victorious hand be feebled here,
That in your chambers gave you chastisement?
No: know the gallant monarch is in arms
And like an eagle o&apos;er his aery towers,
To souse annoyance that comes near his nest.
And you degenerate, you ingrate revolts,
You bloody Neroes, ripping up the womb
Of your dear mother England, blush for shame;
For your own ladies and pale-visaged maids
Like Amazons come tripping after drums,
Their thimbles into armed gauntlets change,
Their needles to lances, and their gentle hearts
To fierce and bloody inclination.

[There end thy brave, and turn thy face in peace;
We grant thou canst outscold us: fare thee well;
We hold our time too precious to be spent
With such a brabbler.]
[Give me leave to speak.]

No, I will speak.

[We will attend to neither.
Strike up the drums; and let the tongue of war
Plead for our interest and our being here.]

Indeed your drums, being beaten, will cry out;
And so shall you, being beaten: do but start
An echo with the clamour of thy drum,
And even at hand a drum is ready braced
That shall reverberate all as loud as thine;
Sound but another, and another shall
As loud as thine rattle the welkin&apos;s ear
And mock the deep-mouth&apos;d thunder: for at hand,
Not trusting to this halting legate here,
Whom he hath used rather for sport than need
Is warlike John; and in his forehead sits
A bare-ribb&apos;d death, whose office is this day
To feast upon whole thousands of the French.</string>

Melun, a mortally mounded French noble, lets the English lords know that if they submit to King John and give up their rebellion before the war goes on much further, the king will be lenient with them. When they don&apos;t believe him, he says he has no reason to lie, since he is dying, and even likes some English people. He request that he be taken away from the battlefiel to die peacefully.</string>

		<string>Fly, noble English, you are bought and sold;
Unthread the rude eye of rebellion
And welcome home again discarded faith.
Seek out King John and fall before his feet;
For if the French be lords of this loud day,
He means to recompense the pains you take
By cutting off your heads: thus hath he sworn
And I with him, and many moe with me,
Upon the altar at Saint Edmundsbury;
Even on that altar where we swore to you
Dear amity and everlasting love.

[May this be possible? may this be true?]

Have I not hideous death within my view,
Retaining but a quantity of life,
Which bleeds away, even as a form of wax
Resolveth from his figure &apos;gainst the fire?
What in the world should make me now deceive,
Since I must lose the use of all deceit?
Why should I then be false, since it is true
That I must die here and live hence by truth?
I say again, if Lewis do win the day,
He is forsworn, if e&apos;er those eyes of yours
Behold another day break in the east:
But even this night, whose black contagious breath
Already smokes about the burning crest
Of the old, feeble and day-wearied sun,
Even this ill night, your breathing shall expire,
Paying the fine of rated treachery
Even with a treacherous fine of all your lives,
If Lewis by your assistance win the day.
Commend me to one Hubert with your king:
The love of him, and this respect besides,
For that my grandsire was an Englishman,
Awakes my conscience to confess all this.
In lieu whereof, I pray you, bear me hence
From forth the noise and rumour of the field,
Where I may think the remnant of my thoughts
In peace, and part this body and my soul
With contemplation and devout desires.</string>

		<string>&apos;Tis not unknown to you, Antonio,
How much I have disabled mine estate,
By something showing a more swelling port
Than my faint means would grant continuance:
Nor do I now make moan to be abridged
From such a noble rate; but my chief care
Is to come fairly off from the great debts
Wherein my time something too prodigal
Hath left me gaged. To you, Antonio,
I owe the most, in money and in love,
And from your love I have a warranty
To unburden all my plots and purposes
How to get clear of all the debts I owe.

In my school-days, when I had lost one shaft,
I shot his fellow of the self-same flight
The self-same way with more advised watch,
To find the other forth, and by adventuring both
I oft found both: I urge this childhood proof,
Because what follows is pure innocence.
I owe you much, and, like a wilful youth,
That which I owe is lost; but if you please
To shoot another arrow that self way
Which you did shoot the first, I do not doubt,
As I will watch the aim, or to find both
Or bring your latter hazard back again
And thankfully rest debtor for the first.

In Belmont is a lady richly left;
And she is fair, and, fairer than that word,
Of wondrous virtues: sometimes from her eyes
I did receive fair speechless messages:
Her name is Portia, nothing undervalued
To Cato&apos;s daughter, Brutus&apos; Portia:
Nor is the wide world ignorant of her worth,
For the four winds blow in from every coast
Renowned suitors, and her sunny locks
Hang on her temples like a golden fleece;
Which makes her seat of Belmont Colchos&apos; strand,
And many Jasons come in quest of her.
O my Antonio, had I but the means
To hold a rival place with one of them,
I have a mind presages me such thrift,
That I should questionless be fortunate!</string>

		<string>Sir,
I am thankful to you; and I&apos;ll go along
By your prescription: but this top-proud fellow,
Whom from the flow of gall I name not but
From sincere motions, by intelligence,
And proofs as clear as founts in July when
We see each grain of gravel, I do know
To be corrupt and treasonous.

[Say not &apos;treasonous.&apos;]

To the king I&apos;ll say&apos;t; and make my vouch as strong
As shore of rock. Attend. This holy fox,
Or wolf, or both,--for he is equal ravenous
As he is subtle, and as prone to mischief
As able to perform&apos;t; his mind and place
Infecting one another, yea, reciprocally--
Only to show his pomp as well in France
As here at home, suggests the king our master
To this last costly treaty, the interview,
That swallow&apos;d so much treasure, and like a glass
Did break i&apos; the rinsing.

[Faith, and so it did.]

Pray, give me favour, sir. This cunning cardinal
The articles o&apos; the combination drew
As himself pleased; and they were ratified
As he cried &apos;Thus let be&apos;: to as much end
As give a crutch to the dead: but our count-cardinal
Has done this, and &apos;tis well; for worthy Wolsey,
Who cannot err, he did it. Now this follows,--
Which, as I take it, is a kind of puppy
To the old dam, treason,--Charles the emperor,
Under pretence to see the queen his aunt--
For &apos;twas indeed his colour, but he came
To whisper Wolsey,--here makes visitation:
His fears were, that the interview betwixt
England and France might, through their amity,
Breed him some prejudice; for from this league
Peep&apos;d harms that menaced him: he privily
Deals with our cardinal; and, as I trow,--
Which I do well; for I am sure the emperor
Paid ere he promised; whereby his suit was granted
Ere it was ask&apos;d; but when the way was made,
And paved with gold, the emperor thus desired,
That he would please to alter the king&apos;s course,
And break the foresaid peace. Let the king know,
As soon he shall by me, that thus the cardinal
Does buy and sell his honour as he pleases,
And for his own advantage.</string>

I am solicited, not by a few,
And those of true condition, that your subjects
Are in great grievance: there have been commissions
Sent down among &apos;em, which hath flaw&apos;d the heart
Of all their loyalties: wherein, although,
My good lord cardinal, they vent reproaches
Most bitterly on you, as putter on
Of these exactions, yet the king our master--
Whose honour heaven shield from soil!--even he escapes not
Language unmannerly, yea, such which breaks
The sides of loyalty, and almost appears
In loud rebellion.</string>

		<string>No, my lord,
You know no more than others; but you frame
Things that are known alike; which are not wholesome
To those which would not know them, and yet must
Perforce be their acquaintance. These exactions,
Whereof my sovereign would have note, they are
Most pestilent to the bearing; and, to bear &apos;em,
The back is sacrifice to the load. They say
They are devised by you; or else you suffer
Too hard an exclamation.

[Still exaction!
The nature of it? in what kind, let&apos;s know,
Is this exaction?]

I am much too venturous
In tempting of your patience; but am bolden&apos;d
Under your promised pardon. The subjects&apos; grief
Comes through commissions, which compel from each
The sixth part of his substance, to be levied
Without delay; and the pretence for this
Is named, your wars in France: this makes bold mouths:
Tongues spit their duties out, and cold hearts freeze
Allegiance in them; their curses now
Live where their prayers did: and it&apos;s come to pass,
This tractable obedience is a slave
To each incensed will. I would your highness
Would give it quick consideration, for
There is no primer business.</string>

		<string>I&apos;ll tell you in a little. The great duke
Came to the bar; where to his accusations
He pleaded still not guilty and alleged
Many sharp reasons to defeat the law.
The king&apos;s attorney on the contrary
Urged on the examinations, proofs, confessions
Of divers witnesses; which the duke desired
To have brought viva voce to his face:
At which appear&apos;d against him his surveyor;
Sir Gilbert Peck his chancellor; and John Car,
Confessor to him; with that devil-monk,
Hopkins, that made this mischief.

[That was he
That fed him with his prophecies?]

The same.
All these accused him strongly; which he fain
Would have flung from him, but, indeed, he could not:
And so his peers, upon this evidence,
Have found him guilty of high treason. Much
He spoke, and learnedly, for life; but all
Was either pitied in him or forgotten.

[After all this, how did he bear himself?]

When he was brought again to the bar, to hear
His knell rung out, his judgment, he was stirr&apos;d
With such an agony, he sweat extremely,
And something spoke in choler, ill, and hasty:
But he fell to himself again, and sweetly
In all the rest show&apos;d a most noble patience.</string>

		<string>All good people,
You that thus far have come to pity me,
Hear what I say, and then go home and lose me.
I have this day received a traitor&apos;s judgment,
And by that name must die: yet, heaven bear witness,
And if I have a co nscience, let it sink me,
Even as the axe falls, if I be not faithful!
The law I bear no malice for my death;
&apos;T has done, upon the premises, but justice:
But those that sought it I could wish more Christians:
Be what they will, I heartily forgive &apos;em:
Yet let &apos;em look they glory not in mischief,
Nor build their evils on the graves of great men;
For then my guiltless blood must cry against &apos;em.
For further life in this world I ne&apos;er hope,
Nor will I sue, although the king have mercies
More than I dare make faults. You few that loved me,
And dare be bold to weep for Buckingham,
His noble friends and fellows, whom to leave
Is only bitter to him, only dying,
Go with me, like good angels, to my end;
And, as the long divorce of steel falls on me,
Make of your prayers one sweet sacrifice,
And lift my soul to heaven. Lead on, o&apos; God&apos;s name.</string>

		<string>Nay, Sir Nicholas,
Let it alone; my state now will but mock me.
When I came hither, I was lord high constable
And Duke of Buckingham; now, poor Edward Bohun:
Yet I am richer than my base accusers,
That never knew what truth meant: I now seal it;
And with that blood will make &apos;em one day groan for&apos;t.
My noble father, Henry of Buckingham,
Who first raised head against usurping Richard,
Flying for succor to his servant Banister,
Being distress&apos;d, was by that wretch betray&apos;d,
And without trial fell; God&apos;s peace be with him!
Henry the Seventh succeeding, truly pitying
My father&apos;s loss, like a most royal prince,
Restored me to my honours, and, out of ruins,
Made my name once more noble. Now his son,
Henry the Eighth, life, honour, name and all
That made me happy at one stroke has taken
For ever from the world. I had my trial,
And, must needs say, a noble one; which makes me,
A little happier than my wretched father:
Yet thus far we are one in fortunes: both
Fell by our servants, by those men we loved most;
A most unnatural and faithless service!
Heaven has an end in all: yet, you that hear me,
This from a dying man receive as certain:
Where you are liberal of your loves and counsels
Be sure you be not loose; for those you make friends
And give your hearts to, when they once perceive
The least rub in your fortunes, fall away
Like water from ye, never found again
But where they mean to sink ye. All good people,
Pray for me! I must now forsake ye: the last hour
Of my long weary life is come upon me. Farewell:
And when you would say something that is sad,
Speak how I fell. I have done; and God forgive me!</string>

Such a hare is madness the youth—to skip o&apos;er the meshes of good counsel the cripple. But this reasoning is not in the fashion to choose me a husband. O me, the word “choose!” I may neither choose whom I would nor refuse whom I dislike—so is the will of a living daughter curbed by the will of a dead father. Is it not hard, Nerissa, that I cannot choose one nor refuse none?</string>

This is the cardinal&apos;s doing, the king-cardinal:
That blind priest, like the eldest son of fortune,
Turns what he list. The king will know him one day.

[Pray God he do! he&apos;ll never know himself else.]

How holily he works in all his business!
And with what zeal! for, now he has crack&apos;d the league
Between us and the emperor, the queen&apos;s great nephew,
He dives into the king&apos;s soul, and there scatters
Dangers, doubts, wringing of the conscience,
Fears, and despairs; and all these for his marriage:
And out of all these to restore the king,
He counsels a divorce; a loss of her
That, like a jewel, has hung twenty years
About his neck, yet never lost her lustre;
Of her that loves him with that excellence
That angels love good men with; even of her
That, when the greatest stroke of fortune falls,
Will bless the king: and is not this course pious?</string>

His highness having lived so long with her, and she
So good a lady that no tongue could ever
Pronounce dishonour of her; by my life,
She never knew harm-doing: O, now, after
So many courses of the sun enthroned,
Still growing in a majesty and pomp, the which
To leave a thousand-fold more bitter than
&apos;Tis sweet at first to acquire,--after this process,
To give her the avaunt! it is a pity
Would move a monster.

[Hearts of most hard temper
Melt and lament for her.]

O, God&apos;s will! much better
She ne&apos;er had known pomp: though&apos;t be temporal,
Yet, if that quarrel, fortune, do divorce
It from the bearer, &apos;tis a sufferance panging
As soul and body&apos;s severing.

[Alas, poor lady!
She&apos;s a stranger now again.]

So much the more
Must pity drop upon her. Verily,
I swear, &apos;tis better to be lowly born,
And range with humble livers in content,
Than to be perk&apos;d up in a glistering grief,
And wear a golden sorrow.</string>

		<string>Sir, I desire you do me right and justice;
And to bestow your pity on me: for
I am a most poor woman, and a stranger,
Born out of your dominions; having here
No judge indifferent, nor no more assurance
Of equal friendship and proceeding. Alas, sir,
In what have I offended you? what cause
Hath my behavior given to your displeasure,
That thus you should proceed to put me off,
And take your good grace from me? Heaven witness,
I have been to you a true and humble wife,
At all times to your will conformable;
Ever in fear to kindle your dislike,
Yea, subject to your countenance, glad or sorry
As I saw it inclined: when was the hour
I ever contradicted your desire,
Or made it not mine too? Or which of your friends
Have I not strove to love, although I knew
He were mine enemy? what friend of mine
That had to him derived your anger, did I
Continue in my liking? nay, gave notice
He was from thence discharged. Sir, call to mind
That I have been your wife, in this obedience,
Upward of twenty years, and have been blest
With many children by you: if, in the course
And process of this time, you can report,
And prove it too, against mine honour aught,
My bond to wedlock, or my love and duty,
Against your sacred person, in God&apos;s name,
Turn me away; and let the foul&apos;st contempt
Shut door upon me, and so give me up
To the sharp&apos;st kind of justice. Please you sir,
The king, your father, was reputed for
A prince most prudent, of an excellent
And unmatch&apos;d wit and judgment: Ferdinand,
My father, king of Spain, was reckon&apos;d one
The wisest prince that there had reign&apos;d by many
A year before: it is not to be question&apos;d
That they had gather&apos;d a wise council to them
Of every realm, that did debate this business,
Who deem&apos;d our marriage lawful: wherefore I humbly
Beseech you, sir, to spare me, till I may
Be by my friends in Spain advised; whose counsel
I will implore: if not, i&apos; the name of God,
Your pleasure be fulfill&apos;d!</string>

I do excuse you; yea, upon mine honour,
I free you from&apos;t. You are not to be taught
That you have many enemies, that know not
Why they are so, but, like to village-curs,
Bark when their fellows do: by some of these
The queen is put in anger. You&apos;re excused:
But will you be more justified? You ever
Have wish&apos;d the sleeping of this business; never desired
It to be stirr&apos;d; but oft have hinder&apos;d, oft,
The passages made toward it: on my honour,
I speak my good lord cardinal to this point,
And thus far clear him. Now, what moved me to&apos;t,
I will be bold with time and your attention:
Then mark the inducement. Thus it came; give heed to&apos;t:
My conscience first received a tenderness,
Scruple, and prick, on certain speeches utter&apos;d
By the Bishop of Bayonne, then French ambassador;
Who had been hither sent on the debating
A marriage &apos;twixt the Duke of Orleans and
Our daughter Mary: i&apos; the progress of this business,
Ere a determinate resolution, he,
I mean the bishop, did require a respite;
Wherein he might the king his lord advertise
Whether our daughter were legitimate,
Respecting this our marriage with the dowager,
Sometimes our brother&apos;s wife. This respite shook
The bosom of my conscience, enter&apos;d me,
Yea, with a splitting power, and made to tremble
The region of my breast; which forced such way,
That many mazed considerings did throng
And press&apos;d in with this caution. First, methought
I stood not in the smile of heaven; who had
Commanded nature, that my lady&apos;s womb,
If it conceived a male child by me, should
Do no more offices of life to&apos;t than
The grave does to the dead; for her male issue
Or died where they were made, or shortly after
This world had air&apos;d them: hence I took a thought,
This was a judgment on me; that my kingdom,
Well worthy the best heir o&apos; the world, should not
Be gladded in&apos;t by me: then follows, that
I weigh&apos;d the danger which my realms stood in
By this my issue&apos;s fail; and that gave to me
Many a groaning throe. Thus hulling in
The wild sea of my conscience, I did steer
Toward this remedy, whereupon we are
Now present here together: that&apos;s to say,
I meant to rectify my conscience,--which
I then did feel full sick, and yet not well,--
By all the reverend fathers of the land
And doctors learn&apos;d: first I began in private
With you, my Lord of Lincoln; you remember
How under my oppression I did reek,
When I first moved you.</string>

Ye speak like honest men; pray God, ye prove so!
But how to make ye suddenly an answer,
In such a point of weight, so near mine honour,--
More near my life, I fear,--with my weak wit,
And to such men of gravity and learning,
In truth, I know not. I was set at work
Among my maids: full little, God knows, looking
Either for such men or such business.
For her sake that I have been,--for I feel
The last fit of my greatness,--good your graces,
Let me have time and counsel for my cause:
Alas, I am a woman, friendless, hopeless!

[Madam, you wrong the king&apos;s love with these fears:
Your hopes and friends are infinite.]

In England
But little for my profit: can you think, lords,
That any Englishman dare give me counsel?
Or be a known friend, &apos;gainst his highness&apos; pleasure,
Though he be grown so desperate to be honest,
And live a subject? Nay, forsooth, my friends,
They that must weigh out my afflictions,
They that my trust must grow to, live not here:
They are, as all my other comforts, far hence
In mine own country, lords.</string>

When she is told by the cardinals that she should trust in King Henry (and by extension, them) she tells them she trusts God more than them, and accuses them of reveling in her misery. She tells them she never sinned as a wife, she does not deserve divorce, and that she wishes she had never come to England.</string>

		<string>Ye tell me what ye wish for both,--my ruin:
Is this your Christian counsel? out upon ye!
Heaven is above all yet; there sits a judge
That no king can corrupt.

[Your rage mistakes us.]

The more shame for ye: holy men I thought ye,
Upon my soul, two reverend cardinal virtues;
But cardinal sins and hollow hearts I fear ye:
Mend &apos;em, for shame, my lords. Is this your comfort?
The cordial that ye bring a wretched lady,
A woman lost among ye, laugh&apos;d at, scorn&apos;d?
I will not wish ye half my miseries;
I have more charity: but say, I warn&apos;d ye;
Take heed, for heaven&apos;s sake, take heed, lest at once
The burthen of my sorrows fall upon ye.

[Madam, this is a mere distraction;
You turn the good we offer into envy.]

Ye turn me into nothing: woe upon ye
And all such false professors! would you have me--
If you have any justice, any pity;
If ye be any thing but churchmen&apos;s habits--
Put my sick cause into his hands that hates me?
Alas, has banish&apos;d me his bed already,
His love, too long ago! I am old, my lords,
And all the fellowship I hold now with him
Is only my obedience. What can happen
To me above this wretchedness? all your studies
Make me a curse like this.

[Your fears are worse.]

Have I lived thus long--let me speak myself,
Since virtue finds no friends--a wife, a true one?
A woman, I dare say without vain-glory,
Never yet branded with suspicion?
Have I with all my full affections
Still met the king? loved him next heaven?
obey&apos;d him?
Been, out of fondness, superstitious to him?
Almost forgot my prayers to content him?
And am I thus rewarded? &apos;tis not well, lords.
Bring me a constant woman to her husband,
One that ne&apos;er dream&apos;d a joy beyond his pleasure;
And to that woman, when she has done most,
Yet will I add an honour, a great patience.

[Madam, you wander from the good we aim at.]

My lord, I dare not make myself so guilty,
To give up willingly that noble title
Your master wed me to: nothing but death
Shall e&apos;er divorce my dignities.

[Pray, hear me.]

Would I had never trod this English earth,
Or felt the flatteries that grow upon it!
Ye have angels&apos; faces, but heaven knows your hearts.
What will become of me now, wretched lady!
I am the most unhappy woman living.
Alas, poor wenches, where are now your fortunes!
Shipwreck&apos;d upon a kingdom, where no pity,
No friend, no hope; no kindred weep for me;
Almost no grave allow&apos;d me: like the lily,
That once was mistress of the field and flourish&apos;d,
I&apos;ll hang my head and perish.</string>

For goodness&apos; sake, consider what you do;
How you may hurt yourself, ay, utterly
Grow from the king&apos;s acquaintance, by this carriage.
The hearts of princes kiss obedience,
So much they love it; but to stubborn spirits
They swell, and grow as terrible as storms.
I know you have a gentle, noble temper,
A soul as even as a calm: pray, think us
Those we profess, peace-makers, friends, and servants.</string>

		<string>Signior Antonio, many a time and oft
In the Rialto you have rated me
About my moneys and my usances:
Still have I borne it with a patient shrug,
For sufferance is the badge of all our tribe.
You call me misbeliever, cut-throat dog,
And spit upon my Jewish gaberdine,
And all for use of that which is mine own.
Well then, it now appears you need my help:
Go to, then; you come to me, and you say
&apos;Shylock, we would have moneys:&apos; you say so;
You, that did void your rheum upon my beard
And foot me as you spurn a stranger cur
Over your threshold: moneys is your suit
What should I say to you? Should I not say
&apos;Hath a dog money? is it possible
A cur can lend three thousand ducats?&apos; Or
Shall I bend low and in a bondman&apos;s key,
With bated breath and whispering humbleness, Say this;
&apos;Fair sir, you spit on me on Wednesday last;
You spurn&apos;d me such a day; another time
You call&apos;d me dog; and for these courtesies
I&apos;ll lend you thus much moneys&apos;?

I would be friends with you and have your love,
Forget the shames that you have stain&apos;d me with,
Supply your present wants and take no doit
Of usance for my moneys, and you&apos;ll not hear me:
This is kind I offer.

This kindness will I show.
Go with me to a notary, seal me there
Your single bond; and, in a merry sport,
If you repay me not on such a day,
In such a place, such sum or sums as are
Express&apos;d in the condition, let the forfeit
Be nominated for an equal pound
Of your fair flesh, to be cut off and taken
In what part of your body pleaseth me.</string>

Leap&apos;d from his eyes: so looks the chafed lion

Then makes him nothing. I must read this paper;
I fear, the story of his anger. &apos;Tis so;
This paper has undone me: &apos;tis the account
Of all that world of wealth I have drawn together
For mine own ends; indeed, to gain the popedom,
And fee my friends in Rome. O negligence!
Fit for a fool to fall by: what cross devil
Made me put this main secret in the packet
I sent the king? Is there no way to cure this?
No new device to beat this from his brains?
I know &apos;twill stir him strongly; yet I know
A way, if it take right, in spite of fortune
Will bring me off again. What&apos;s this? &apos;To the Pope!&apos;
The letter, as I live, with all the business
I writ to&apos;s holiness. Nay then, farewell!
I have touch&apos;d the highest point of all my greatness;
And, from that full meridian of my glory,
I haste now to my setting: I shall fall
Like a bright exhalation m the evening,
And no man see me more.</string>

Of our despised nobility, our issues,

Produce the grand sum of his sins, the articles
Collected from his life. I&apos;ll startle you
Worse than the scaring bell, when the brown wench
Lay kissing in your arms, lord cardinal.</string>

		<string>So farewell to the little good you bear me.
Farewell! a long farewell, to all my greatness!
This is the state of man: to-day he puts forth
The tender leaves of hopes; to-morrow blossoms,
And bears his blushing honours thick upon him;
The third day comes a frost, a killing frost,
And, when he thinks, good easy man, full surely
His greatness is a-ripening, nips his root,
And then he falls, as I do. I have ventured,
Like little wanton boys that swim on bladders,
This many summers in a sea of glory,
But far beyond my depth: my high-blown pride
At length broke under me and now has left me,
Weary and old with service, to the mercy
Of a rude stream, that must for ever hide me.
Vain pomp and glory of this world, I hate ye:
I feel my heart new open&apos;d. O, how wretched
Is that poor man that hangs on princes&apos; favours!
There is, betwixt that smile we would aspire to,
That sweet aspect of princes, and their ruin,
More pangs and fears than wars or women have:
And when he falls, he falls like Lucifer,
Never to hope again.</string>

		<string>Cromwell, I did not think to shed a tear
In all my miseries; but thou hast forced me,
Out of thy honest truth, to play the woman.
Let&apos;s dry our eyes: and thus far hear me, Cromwell;
And, when I am forgotten, as I shall be,
And sleep in dull cold marble, where no mention
Of me more must be heard of, say, I taught thee,
Say, Wolsey, that once trod the ways of glory,
And sounded all the depths and shoals of honour,
Found thee a way, out of his wreck, to rise in;
A sure and safe one, though thy master miss&apos;d it.
Mark but my fall, and that that ruin&apos;d me.
Cromwell, I charge thee, fling away ambition:
By that sin fell the angels; how can man, then,
The image of his Maker, hope to win by it?
Love thyself last: cherish those hearts that hate thee;
Corruption wins not more than honesty.
Still in thy right hand carry gentle peace,
To silence envious tongues. Be just, and fear not:
Let all the ends thou aim&apos;st at be thy country&apos;s,
Thy God&apos;s, and truth&apos;s; then if thou fall&apos;st,
O Cromwell,
Thou fall&apos;st a blessed martyr! Serve the king;
And,--prithee, lead me in:
There take an inventory of all I have,
To the last penny; &apos;tis the king&apos;s: my robe,
And my integrity to heaven, is all
I dare now call mine own. O Cromwell, Cromwell!
Had I but served my God with half the zeal
I served my king, he would not in mine age
Have left me naked to mine enemies.

[Good sir, have patience.]

So I have. Farewell
The hopes of court! my hopes in heaven do dwell.</string>

Well worth the seeing.

[Good sir, speak it to us.]

As well as I am able. The rich stream
Of lords and ladies, having brought the queen
To a prepared place in the choir, fell off
A distance from her; while her grace sat down
To rest awhile, some half an hour or so,
In a rich chair of state, opposing freely
The beauty of her person to the people.
Believe me, sir, she is the goodliest woman
That ever lay by man: which when the people
Had the full view of, such a noise arose
As the shrouds make at sea in a stiff tempest,
As loud, and to as many tunes: hats, cloaks--
Doublets, I think,--flew up; and had their faces
Been loose, this day they had been lost. Such joy
I never saw before. Great-bellied women,
That had not half a week to go, like rams
In the old time of war, would shake the press,
And make &apos;em reel before &apos;em. No man living
Could say &apos;This is my wife&apos; there; all were woven
So strangely in one piece.

[But, what follow&apos;d?]

At length her grace rose, and with modest paces
Came to the altar; where she kneel&apos;d, and saint-like
Cast her fair eyes to heaven and pray&apos;d devoutly.
Then rose again and bow&apos;d her to the people:
When by the Archbishop of Canterbury
She had all the royal makings of a queen;
As holy oil, Edward Confessor&apos;s crown,
The rod, and bird of peace, and all such emblems
Laid nobly on her: which perform&apos;d, the choir,
With all the choicest music of the kingdom,
Together sung &apos;Te Deum.&apos; So she parted,
And with the same full state paced back again
To York-place, where the feast is held.</string>

		<string>Well, the voice goes, madam:
For after the stout Earl Northumberland
Arrested him at York, and brought him forward,
As a man sorely tainted, to his answer,
He fell sick suddenly, and grew so ill
He could not sit his mule.

[Alas, poor man!]

At last, with easy roads, he came to Leicester,
Lodged in the abbey; where the reverend abbot,
With all his covent, honourably received him;
To whom he gave these words, &apos;O, father abbot,
An old man, broken with the storms of state,
Is come to lay his weary bones among ye;
Give him a little earth for charity!&apos;
So went to bed; where eagerly his sickness
Pursued him still: and, three nights after this,
About the hour of eight, which he himself
Foretold should be his last, full of repentance,
Continual meditations, tears, and sorrows,
He gave his honours to the world again,
His blessed part to heaven, and slept in peace.

[So may he rest; his faults lie gently on him!
...
Of his own body he was ill, and gave
The clergy in example.]

Noble madam,
Men&apos;s evil manners live in brass; their virtues
We write in water. May it please your highness
To hear me speak his good now?

[Yes, good Griffith;
I were malicious else.]

This cardinal,
Though from an humble stock, undoubtedly
Was fashion&apos;d to much honour from his cradle.
He was a scholar, and a ripe and good one;
Exceeding wise, fair-spoken, and persuading:
Lofty and sour to them that loved him not;
But to those men that sought him sweet as summer.
And though he were unsatisfied in getting,
Which was a sin, yet in bestowing, madam,
He was most princely: ever witness for him
Those twins Of learning that he raised in you,
Ipswich and Oxford! one of which fell with him,
Unwilling to outlive the good that did it;
The other, though unfinish&apos;d, yet so famous,
So excellent in art, and still so rising,
That Christendom shall ever speak his virtue.
His overthrow heap&apos;d happiness upon him;
For then, and not till then, he felt himself,
And found the blessedness of being little:
And, to add greater honours to his age
Than man could give him, he died fearing God.</string>

Yet thus far, Griffith, give me leave to speak him,

Himself with princes; one that, by suggestion,
Tied all the kingdom: simony was fair-play;
His own opinion was his law: i&apos; the presence
He would say untruths; and be ever double
Both in his words and meaning: he was never,
But where he meant to ruin, pitiful:
His promises were, as he then was, mighty;
But his performance, as he is now, nothing:
Of his own body he was ill, and gave

		<string>Sir, I most humbly pray you to deliver
This to my lord the king.

[Most willing, madam.]

In which I have commended to his goodness
The model of our chaste loves, his young daughter;
The dews of heaven fall thick in blessings on her!
Beseeching him to give her virtuous breeding--
She is young, and of a noble modest nature,
I hope she will deserve well,--and a little
To love her for her mother&apos;s sake, that loved him,
Heaven knows how dearly. My next poor petition
Is, that his noble grace would have some pity
Upon my wretched women, that so long
Have follow&apos;d both my fortunes faithfully:
Of which there is not one, I dare avow,
And now I should not lie, but will deserve
For virtue and true beauty of the soul,
For honesty and decent carriage,
A right good husband, let him be a noble
And, sure, those men are happy that shall have &apos;em.
The last is, for my men; they are the poorest,
But poverty could never draw &apos;em from me;
That they may have their wages duly paid &apos;em,
And something over to remember me by:
If heaven had pleased to have given me longer life
And able means, we had not parted thus.
These are the whole contents: and, good my lord,
By that you love the dearest in this world,
As you wish Christian peace to souls departed,
Stand these poor people&apos;s friend, and urge the king
To do me this last right.

[By heaven, I will,
Or let me lose the fashion of a man!]

I thank you, honest lord. Remember me
In all humility unto his highness:
Say his long trouble now is passing
Out of this world; tell him, in death I bless&apos;d him,
For so I will. Mine eyes grow dim. Farewell,
My lord. Griffith, farewell. Nay, Patience,
You must not leave me yet: I must to bed;
Call in more women. When I am dead, good wench,
Let me be used with honour: strew me over
With maiden flowers, that all the world may know
I was a chaste wife to my grave: embalm me,
Then lay me forth: although unqueen&apos;d, yet like
A queen, and daughter to a king, inter me.
I can no more.</string>

		<string>Act 5. Scene 1.
When Cranmer says he is not afraid of accusations against him, King Henry reminds him of his enemies, and that he could be in trouble of enough people testify against him. The king promises Cranmer that he can help, giving him a ring as proof that nothing can be done to him until the king has heard his appeal.</string>

		<string>Know you not
How your state stands i&apos; the world, with the whole world?
Your enemies are many, and not small; their practises
Must bear the same proportion; and not ever
The justice and the truth o&apos; the question carries
The due o&apos; the verdict with it: at what ease
Might corrupt minds procure knaves as corrupt
To swear against you? such things have been done.
You are potently opposed; and with a malice
Of as great size. Ween you of better luck,
I mean, in perjured witness, than your master,
Whose minister you are, whiles here he lived
Upon this naughty earth? Go to, go to;
You take a precipice for no leap of danger,
And woo your own destruction.

[God and your majesty
Protect mine innocence, or I fall into
The trap is laid for me!]

Be of good cheer;
They shall no more prevail than we give way to.
Keep comfort to you; and this morning see
You do appear before them: if they shall chance,
In charging you with matters, to commit you,
The best persuasions to the contrary
Fail not to use, and with what vehemency
The occasion shall instruct you: if entreaties
Will render you no remedy, this ring
Deliver them, and your appeal to us
There make before them. Look, the good man weeps!
He&apos;s honest, on mine honour. God&apos;s blest mother!
I swear he is true--hearted; and a soul
None better in my kingdom. Get you gone,
And do as I have bid you.</string>
